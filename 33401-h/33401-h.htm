<h2>PREFACE.</h2>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">The</span> readers of German autobiography
(and more delightful reading cannot be
had) will perceive that I have made use
of some passages in the childhood of
Heinrich Jung-Stilling to create the character
of Little Mark. The experience of
the Princess as to private religious societies
was also that of Stilling. Should this
little tale induce any one, at present
ignorant of Stilling's Autobiography, to
read that book, they will forget any
grudge they may have formed against the
present writer. As a matter of common
honesty I should wish to express the
pleasure I have had in reading another
delightful book, <i>Studies of the Eighteenth
Century in Italy</i>, by Vernon Lee.</div>

<p>The words of the anthem in the
concluding chapter are taken from a
sermon by Canon Knox Little, "The
Vision of the Truth," preached in St.
Paul's in Lent 1883, and published in
<i>The Witness of the Passion</i>. They are so
exactly in accord with the message which
the shadowy beings of my tale seem to
have left me that I cannot force myself to
coin another phrase.</p>

<h2>I.</h2>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">The</span> Court Chaplain Eisenhart walked up
the village street towards the schoolhouse.
It was April, in the year 1750, and a soft
west wind was blowing up the street, across
the oak woods of the near forest. Between
the forest and the village lay a valley of
meadows, planted with thorn bushes and
old birch trees with snow-white stems:
the fresh green leaves trembled continually
in the restless wind. On the other side<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
of the street a lofty crag rose precipitously
above a rushing mountain torrent. This
rock is the spur of other lofty hills, planted
with oak and beech trees, through the
openings of which a boy may frequently
be seen, driving an ox or gathering firewood
on his half-trodden path. Here and
there in the distance the smoke of charcoal-burners
ascends into the sky. Between
the street and the torrent stand the houses
of the village, with high thatched roofs
and walls of timber and of mud, and, at
the back, projecting stages and steps above
the rushing water. A paradise in the late
spring, in summer, and in autumn, these
wild and romantic woods, traversed only by
a few forest paths, are terrible in winter,
and the contrast is part of their charm.
The schoolhouse stands in the upper part<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
of the village, on the opposite side of the
street to the rest of the houses, looking
across the valley to the western sun. Two
large birch trees are before the open door.
The Court Chaplain pauses before he goes
in.</div>

<p>How it comes to pass that a Court
Chaplain should be walking up the street
of this forest village we shall see anon.</p>

<p>At first sight there does not seem to
be much schoolwork going on. A boy, or
we should rather say a child, of fifteen is
seated at an open window looking over
the forest. He is fair-haired and blue-eyed;
but it is the deep blue of an angel's,
not the cold gray blue of a courtier's eyes.
Around him are seated several children,
both boys and girls; and, far from teaching,
he appears to be relating stories to them.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
The story, whatever it is, ceases as the
Court Chaplain goes in, and both raconteur
and audience rise.</p>

<p>"I have something to say to thee,
schoolmaster," said the Chaplain, "send
the children away. Thou wilt not teach
them anything more to-day, I suspect."</p>

<p>The children went away lingeringly,
not at all like children just let loose from
school.</p>

<p>When they were gone the expression
of the Chaplain's face changed&mdash;he looked
at the little schoolmaster very kindly, and
sat down on one of the benches, which
were black and worn with age.</p>

<p>"Last year, little one," he said, "when
the Herr Rector took thee away from the
Latin school and from thy father's tailoring,
and confirmed thee, and thou tookest thy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
first communion, and he made thee schoolmaster
here, many wise people shook their
heads. I do not think," he continued, with
a smile, "that they have ceased shaking
them when they have seen in how strange
a manner thou keepest school."</p>

<p>"Ah, your Reverence," said the boy,
eagerly, "the good people are satisfied
enough when they see that their children
learn without receiving much correction;
and many of them even take pleasure in
the beautiful tales which I relate to the
children, and which they repeat to them.
Every morning, as soon as the children
enter the school, I pray with them, and
catechise them in the principles of our
holy religion, as God teaches me, for I use
no book. Then I set the children to read
and to write, and promise them these<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
charming tales if they learn well. It is
impossible to express with what zeal the
children learn. When they are perverse
or not diligent I do not relate my histories,
but I read to myself."</p>

<p>"Well, little one," said the Court Chaplain,
"it is a strange system of education,
but I am far from saying that it is a bad
one. Nevertheless it will not last. The
Herr Rector has his eye upon thee, and will
send thee back to thy tailoring very soon."</p>

<p>The tears came into the little schoolmaster's
eyes, and he turned very pale.</p>

<p>"Well, do not be sad," said the Chaplain.
"I have been thinking and working
for thee. Thou hast heard of the Prince,
though thou hast, I think, never seen the
pleasure palace, Joyeuse, though it is so
near."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p>"I have seen the iron gates with the
golden scrolls," said the boy. "They are
like the heavenly Jerusalem; every several
gate is one pearl."</p>

<p>The Chaplain did not notice the confused
metaphor of this description.</p>

<p>"Well," he said, "I have been speaking
to the Prince of thee. Thou knowest
nothing of these things, but the Prince has
lived for many years in Italy, a country
where they do nothing but sing and dance.
He has come back, as thou knowest, and
has married a wife, according to the traditions
of his race. Since he came back
to Germany he has taken a fancy to this
forest-lodge, for at first it was little more,
and has garnished it and enlarged it
according to his southern fancies; that
is why he likes it better than his princely<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
cities. He has two children&mdash;a boy and a
girl&mdash;eight and nine, or thereabouts. The
Princess is not a good woman. She neglects
her children, and she prefers the
princely cities to her husband, to her little
ones, and to the beautiful forests and hills."</p>

<p>The little schoolmaster listened with
open eyes. Then he said, beneath his
breath:</p>

<p>"How Satanic that must be!"</p>

<p>"The Prince," continued the Court
Chaplain, "is a beautiful soul 'manqu&eacute;,'
which means spoilt. His sister, the Princess
Isoline von Isenberg-Wertheim, is such a
soul. She has joined herself to a company
of pious people who have taken an old
manor-house belonging to the Prince on the
farther side of the palace gardens, where
they devote themselves to prayer, to good<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
works, and to the manufacture of half-silk
stuffs, by which they maintain themselves
and give to the poor. The Prince himself
knows something of such feelings. He
indeed knows the way of piety, though he
does not follow it. He acknowledges the
grace of refinement which piety gives, even
to the most highly bred. He is particularly
desirous that his children should
possess this supreme touch. Something
that I told him of thee pleased his fancy.
Thy strange way of keeping school seemed
to him very new; more especially was he
delighted with that infancy story of thee
and old Father Stalher. The old man,
I told the Prince, came into thy father's
for his new coat and found thee reading.
Reading, in any one, seemed to Father
Stalher little short of miraculous; but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
in a child of eight it was more&mdash;it was
elfish.</p>

<p>"'What are you doing there, child?'
said Father Stalher.</p>

<p>"'I am reading.'</p>

<p>"'Canst thou read already?'</p>

<p>"'That is a foolish question, for I am
a human being,' said the child, and began
to read with ease, proper emphasis, and
due distinction.</p>

<p>"Stalher was amazed, and said:</p>

<p>"'The devil fetch me, I have never
seen the like in all my life.'</p>

<p>"Then little Mark jumped up and looked
timidly and carefully round the room.
When he saw that the devil did not come,
he went down on his knees in the middle
of the floor and said:</p>

<p>"'O God! how gracious art thou.'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then, standing up boldly before old
Stalher, he said:</p>

<p>"'Man, hast thou ever seen Satan?'</p>

<p>"'No.'</p>

<p>"'Then call upon him no more.'</p>

<p>"And the child went quietly into another
room.</p>

<p>"And I told the Prince what thy old
grandfather used to say to me.</p>

<p>"'The lad is soaring away from us; we
must pray that God will guide him by His
good Spirit.'</p>

<p>"When I told all this to the Prince, he
said:</p>

<p>"'I will have this boy. He shall teach
my children as he does the village ones.
None can teach children as can such a
child as this.'"</p>

<p>The little schoolmaster had been looking<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
before him all the time the Chaplain
had been speaking, as though in something
of a maze. He evidently saw
nothing to wonder at in the story of himself
and old Stalher. It seemed to him
commonplace and obvious enough.</p>

<p>"I shall send up a tailor from Joyeuse
to-morrow," said the Chaplain; "a court
tailor, such as thou never saw'st, nor thy
father either. He must measure thee for
a court-suit of black. Then we will go
together, and I will present thee to the
Prince."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>II.</h2>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">A few</span> days after this conversation there
was a melancholy procession down the
village street. The Court Chaplain and
the schoolmaster walked first; the boy was
crying bitterly. Then followed all the
children of the school, all weeping, and
many peasant women, and two or three old
men. The Rector stood in a corner of
the churchyard under a great walnut tree
and looked on. He did not weep. The
Court Chaplain looked ashamed, for all
the people took this misfortune to be of
his causing.</div>

<p>When they had gone some way out<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
of the village the children stopped, and,
collecting into a little crowd, they wept
more than ever. The Chaplain turned
round and waved his hand, but the little
schoolmaster was too troubled to take any
farewell. He covered his face with his
hands and went on, weeping bitterly. At
last they passed away out of sight.</p>

<p>When they had gone on some distance,
the boy became calmer; he took his hands
from his face, and looked up at the Chaplain
through his tears.</p>

<p>"What am I to do when I come to the
Prince, your Reverence?" he said.</p>

<p>"Thou must make a bow as best thou
canst," said the other; "thou must not
speak till the Prince speaks to thee, and
thou must say 'Highness' sometimes, but
not too often."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>"How am I to tell when to say 'Highness'
and when to forbear?" said the boy.</p>

<p>"Ah! that I cannot tell thee. Thou
must trust in God; He will show thee when
to say 'Highness' and when not."</p>

<p>They went forward in this way across
the meadows, and through the scattered
forest for two leagues or more, in the mid-day
heat. The boy was not used to
labour, and he grew very tired and unhappy.
It seemed to him that he was leaving behind
all that was fair and true and beautiful,
and going to that which was false and
garish and unkind. At last they came to
an open drive, or avenue of the forest,
where great oaks were growing. Some
distance up the avenue they saw a high
park pale stretching away on either hand,
and in the centre of the drive were iron<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
gates covered with gilt scrolls and letters.
The Court Chaplain pushed the gates open,
and they went in.</p>

<p>Inside, the forest drive was planted
with young trees in triple rows. After
walking for some distance they reached
another gate, similar to the first, but provided
with "loges," or guardrooms, on
either side. One or two soldiers were
standing listlessly about, but they took no
heed. Here the drive entered the palace
gardens, laid out in grass plots and stone
terraces, and crossed by lofty hedges which
shut out the view. They approached the
long fa&ccedil;ade of a house with pointed roofs
and green shutter blinds to all the windows.
Here the Chaplain left the path, and conducted
his companion to a remote side
entrance; and, after passing through many<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
passages and small rooms, at last left him
to the tender mercies of the court tailor
and some domestics, at whose hands the
little schoolmaster suffered what appeared
to him to be unspeakable indignities. He
was washed from head to foot, his hair was
cut, curled, and frizzled, and he was finally
arrayed in a plain suit of black silk, with
silk stockings, and delicate shoes with
silver buckles, and plain linen bands like
a clergyman. The worn homespun suit
that had become dear to him was ruthlessly
thrown upon a dust-heap, and a message
was sent to Herr Chaplain that his
<i>prot&eacute;g&eacute;</i> was now fit to be presented to the
Prince.</p>

<p>The boy could scarcely restrain his
tears; he felt as though he were wandering
through the paths of a miserable dream.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
Ah! could he only awake and find himself
again in the old schoolhouse, narrating
the adventures of the Fair Melusina to
the attentive little ones.</p>

<p>The Chaplain led him up some back
stairs, and through corridors and anterooms,
all full of wonderful things, which
the boy passed bewildered, till they reached
a small room where were two boys apparently
of his own age. They appeared to
have been just engaged in punching each
other's heads, for their hair was disordered,
their faces red, and one was in tears.
They regarded the Chaplain with a sullen
suspicion, and the schoolmaster with undisguised
contempt. The door at the farther
side of the room was partly open, the
Chaplain scratched upon it, and, receiving
some answer, they went in.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>The little schoolmaster dared scarcely
breathe when he got into the room, so
surprising was all he saw. To the left of
the door, as they came in, was placed a
harpsichord, before which was standing,
with her back towards them, a young girl
whose face they could not see; by her side,
at the harpsichord, was seated an elderly
man upon whom the boy gazed with
wonder, so different was he from anything
that he had ever seen before; opposite
to them, in the window, hung a canary in a
cage, and the boy perceived, even in the
surprise of the moment, that the bird was
agitated and troubled. But the next
moment all his attention was absorbed by
the figure of the Prince, who was seated
on a couch to the right of the room, and
almost facing them. To say that this was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
the most wonderful sight that the little
schoolmaster had ever seen would be to
speak foolishly, for he had seen no wonderful
sights, but it surpassed the wildest imagination
of his dreams. The Prince was
a very handsome man of about thirty-five,
of a slight and delicate figure, and
of foreign manners and pose. He was
dressed in a suit of what seemed to the
boy a wonderful white cloth, of a soft
material, embroidered in silk, with flowers
of the most lovely tints. The coat was
sparingly ornamented in this manner, but
the waistcoat, which was only partly seen,
was a mass of these exquisite flowers. At
his throat and wrists were masses of costly
lace, and his hair was frizzled, and slightly
powdered, which increased the delicate
expression of his features, which were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
perfectly cut. He lay back on the couch,
caressing, with his right hand, a small
monkey, also gorgeously dressed, and
armed with a toy sword, who sat on the
arm of the sofa cracking nuts, and throwing
the shells upon the carpet.</p>

<p>The Prince looked up as the two came
in, and waved his disengaged hand for
them to stand back, and the next moment
the strange phantasmagoria, into which
the boy's life was turned, took another
phase, and he again lost all perception of
what he had seen before; for there burst
into the little room the most wonderful
voice, which not only he and the Chaplain,
but even the Maestro and the Prince, had
well-nigh ever heard.</p>

<p>The girl, who was taking her music
lesson, had been discovered in Italy by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
the old Maestro, who managed the music
of the private theatre which the Prince
had formed. He had heard her, a poor
untaught girl, in a coffee-house in Venice,
and she afterwards became, in the opinion
of some, the most pathetic female actress
and singer of the century.</p>

<p>The first chord of her voice penetrated
into the boy's nature as nothing had ever
done before; he had never heard any
singing save that of the peasants at church,
and of the boys and girls who sang hymns
round the cottage hearths in the winter
nights.</p>

<p>The solemn tramp of the Lutheran
measures, where the deep basses of the
men drown the women's soft voices, and
the shrill unshaded singing of the children,
could hardly belong to this art, which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
he heard now for the first time. These
sudden runs and trills, so fantastic and
difficult, these chords and harmonies, so
quaint and full of colour, were messages
from a world of sound, as yet an unknown
country to the boy. He stood gazing
upon the singer with open mouth. The
Prince moved his jewelled hand slightly in
unison with the notes; the monkey, apparently
rather scared, left off cracking his
nuts, and, creeping close to his master,
nestled against his beautiful coat close to
the star upon his breast.</p>

<p>Then suddenly, in this world of wonders,
a still more wonderful thing occurred.
There entered into this bewitching, this
entrancing voice, a strange, almost a
discordant, note. Through the fantasied
gaiety of the theme, to which the sustained<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
whirr of the harpsichord was like the sigh
of the wind through the long grass, there
was perceptible a strain, a tremor of
sadness, almost of sobs. It was as if, in
the midst of festival, some hidden grief,
known beforetime of all, but forgotten or
suppressed, should at once and in a moment
well up in the hearts of all, turning the
dance-measures into funeral chants, the
love-songs into the loveliest of chorales.
The Maestro faltered in his accompaniment;
the Prince left off marking the time,
he swept the monkey from him with a
movement of his hand, and leaned forward
eagerly in his seat: the discarded favourite
slunk into a corner, where it leaned disconsolately
against the wall. The pathetic
strain went on, growing more tremulous
and more intense, when suddenly the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
singing stopped, the girl buried her face
in her hands and sank upon the floor in a
passion of tears; the boy sprang forward, he
forgot where he was, he forgot the Prince&mdash;</p>

<p>"It is the bird," he cried, "the bird!"</p>

<p>The canary, whose dying struggles the
singer had been watching through her
song, gave a final shudder and fell lifeless
from its perch.</p>

<p>The Prince rose: he lifted the singer
from her knees, and, taking her hands from
the wet face, he turned to the others with
a smile.</p>

<p>"Ah, Herr Chaplain," he said, "you
come in a good hour. This then is the
angel-child. They will console each
other."</p>

<p>And, picking up the monkey as he
passed, he left the room by another door.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>III.</h2>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">When</span> the Prince was gone the Maestro
gathered up some music and turned to his
pupil, who was drying her eyes and looking
somewhat curiously at the boy through her
tears.</div>

<p>"Well, Signorina," he said, "you truly
sang that very well. If you could bring
some of that 'timbre' into your voice
always, you would indeed be a singer.
But you are too light, too 'frivole.' I wish
we could have a canary always who would
die;" and, bowing very slightly to the
Chaplain, he left the room.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>Then the Chaplain looked kindly at the
young people.</p>

<p>"Fr&auml;ulein," he said, "this is the young
tutor to the little serene Highnesses, I will
leave you together, as the Prince wished."</p>

<p>When they were alone the boy felt very
uncomfortable. He was very shy. This
perhaps was as well, for there was no shyness
at all on the part of his companion.</p>

<p>"So," she said, looking at him with a
smile, and eyes that were again bright,
"you are the new toy. I have heard of
you. You are a wonderful holy child;
what they call 'pious' in this country.
How very funny! come and give me a
kiss."</p>

<p>"No, Fr&auml;ulein," said Mark, blushing
still more, "that would be improper in me."</p>

<p>"Would it?" said the girl lightly; "don't<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
angels kiss? How very stupid it must be
to be an angel! Come and look at poor
'Fifine' then! I suppose she is quite
dead."</p>

<p>And, opening the cage, she took out
the piteous heap of yellow feathers and
held it in her delicate hand, while the tears
came again into her large dark eyes.</p>

<p>"Ah! it was dreadful," she said, "to
sing and see him die."</p>

<p>"But, Fr&auml;ulein," said the boy, "you
sang most beautifully. I never heard anything
so wonderful. It was heaven itself."</p>

<p>The girl looked at him very kindly.</p>

<p>"Oh, you like my singing," she said, "I
am glad of that. Do you know, we shall
be great friends. I like you. You are a
very pretty boy."</p>

<p>And she tried to put her arm round his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
neck. Mark eluded her embrace. "Fr&auml;ulein,"
he said, with a dignified air, which
made his companion laugh, "you must
remember that I am tutor to their serene
Highnesses; I shall be very glad to be
friends with you, and you will tell me
something about the people in the palace."</p>

<p>"Oh!" replied the girl, "there is no
one but our own company, but they are
the greatest fun, and better fun here than
anywhere else. It is delightful to see
them among these stupid, solemn, heavy
Germans, with their terrible language. I
shall love to see you with them, you will
stare your pretty eyes out. There's old
Carricchio&mdash;that's not his name, you know,
but he is called so because of his part&mdash;that
is the best of them, they are always
the same&mdash;off the stage or on it&mdash;always<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
laughing, always joking, always kicking up
their heels. You will see the faces&mdash;such
delicious grimaces, old Carricchio will make
at you when he asks you for the salt. But
don't be frightened, I'll take care of you.
They are all in love with me, but I like
you already better than all of them. You
shall come on yourself sometime, just as
you are; you will make a delightful
part."</p>

<p>Mark stared at her with amazement.</p>

<p>"But what are these people?" he said;
"what do they do?"</p>

<p>"Oh, you will see," she said, laughing;
"how can I tell you. You never dreamt
of such things; you will stare your eyes
out. Well, there's the Prince, and the little
Highnesses, and the old <i>Barotin</i>, the
governess, and"&mdash;here a change came over<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
the girl's face&mdash;"and the Princess is coming
soon, I hear, with her '<i>servente</i>.'"</p>

<p>"The Princess!" said the boy, "does
she ever come?"</p>

<p>"Yes, she comes, sometimes," said his
companion. "I wish she didn't. She is a
bad woman. I hate her."</p>

<p>"Why? and what is her '<i>servente?</i>'"</p>

<p>"I hate her," said the girl; "her <i>servente</i>
is the Count&mdash;<i>Cavali&egrave;re-servente</i>, you know"&mdash;and
her face became quite hard and
fierce&mdash;"he is the devil himself."</p>

<p>The little schoolmaster's face became
quite pale.</p>

<p>"The devil!" he said, staring with his
large blue eyes.</p>

<p>"Oh! you foolish boy!" she said, laughing
again, "I don't mean that devil. The
Count is a much more real devil than he!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>The boy looked so dreadfully shocked
that she grew quite cheerful again.</p>

<p>"What a strange boy you are!" she said,
laughing. "Do you think he will come
and take you away? I'll take care of you&mdash;come
and sit on my lap;" and, sitting
down, she spread out her lap for him with
an inviting gesture.</p>

<p>Mark rejected this attractive offer with
disdain, and looked so unspeakably miserable
and ready to cry that his companion
took pity upon him.</p>

<p>"Poor boy," she said, "you shan't be
teased any more. Come with me, I will
take you to the <i>Barotin</i>, and present you
to the little serene Highnesses. They are
nice children&mdash;for Highnesses; you will
get on well with them."</p>

<p>Taking the boy's unwilling hand, she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
led him through several rooms, lined with
old marquetterie cabinets in the Italian
fashion, till she found a page, to whom she
delivered Mark, telling him to take him to
the Baroness, into whose presence she herself
did not appear anxious to intrude, that
he might be presented to his future pupils.</p>

<p>The page promised to obey, and, giving
him a box on the ear to ensure attention,
a familiarity which he took with the most
cheerful and forgiving air, she left the
room.</p>

<p>The moment she was gone the page
made a rush at Mark, and, seizing him
round the waist, lifted him from the ground
and ran with him through two or three
rooms, till he reached a door, where he
deposited him upon his feet. Then throwing
open the door, he announced suddenly,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
"The Herr Tutor to the serene Highnesses!"
and shut Mark into the room.</p>

<p>His breath taken away by this atrocious
attack upon his person and dignity, Mark
saw before him a stately, but not unkindly-looking
lady and two beautiful children, a
boy and girl, of about eight and nine years
of age. The lady rose, and, looking at
Mark with some curiosity, as well she
might, said:</p>

<p>"Your serene Highnesses, this is the
tutor whom the Prince, your father, has
provided for you. You will no doubt
profit greatly by his instructions."</p>

<p>The little girl came forward at once,
and gave Mark her hand, which, not knowing
what to do with, he held for a moment
and then dropped.</p>

<p>"My papa has spoken of you," she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
said. "He has told me that you are very
good."</p>

<p>"I shall try to be good, Princess," said
Mark, who by this time had recovered his
breath.</p>

<p>The little girl seemed very much insulted.
She drew herself up and flushed
all over her face.</p>

<p>"You must not say <i>Princess</i> to me,"
she said, "that is what only the little
Princes say. You must say, 'my most
gracious and serene Highness,' whenever
you speak to me."</p>

<p>This was too much. Mark blushed
with anger.</p>

<p>"May God forgive me," he said, "if I
do anything so foolish. I am here to
teach thee and thy brother, and I will do
it in my own way, or not at all."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>The little Princess looked as if she were
about to cry, then, apparently thinking
better of it, she said, with a half sob, and
dropping the stately "<i>you</i>"<i>:</i></p>

<p>"Well, my papa says that thou art an
angel. I suppose thou must do as thou
wilt."</p>

<p>The little boy, meanwhile, had been
staring at Mark with solemn eyes. He
said nothing, but he came, finally, to the
little schoolmaster and put his hand in
his.</p>

<p>What more might have been said cannot
be told, for at this moment the page
appeared again, saying that dinner was
served at the third table, and that the
Herr Tutor was to dine there.</p>

<p>The Baroness seemed surprised at this.</p>

<p>"I should have supposed," she said,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
"that he would have dined with the Chaplain
at the second table."</p>

<p>"No," asserted the page boldly, "the
Prince has ordered it."</p>

<p>When alone, the Prince seldom dined
ostensibly in public; but often appeared
masqued at the third table, which was that
of the actors and singers. He had given
no orders at all about Mark. The arrangement
was entirely of the Signorina's making,
who desired that he should dine with her.
It was a bold stroke; and an hour afterwards,
when the Court Chaplain discovered
it, measures were taken to prevent its recurrence&mdash;at
least for a time.</p>

<p>In whatever way this arrangement came
to be made, however, the result was very
advantageous to Mark. In the first place,
it was not formidable. The company took<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
little notice of him. Signor Carricchio
made grotesque faces at others, but not
at him. He sat quite safe and snug by
the Signorina, and certainly stared with all
his eyes, as she had said. The long, dark,
aquiline features of the men, the mobile
play of humorous farce upon their faces,
the constant chatter and sport&mdash;what could
the German peasant boy do but stare?
His friend taught him how to hold his
knife and fork, and how to eat. The
Italians were very nice in their eating, and
the boy picked up more in five minutes
from the Signorina&mdash;he was very quick&mdash;than
he would have done in weeks from
the Chaplain.</p>

<p>He was so scared and frightened, and
the girl was so kind to him, that his boy's
heart went out to her.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>"What shall I call you, Signorina?" he
said, as dinner was over. "You are so
good to me." He had already caught the
Italian word.</p>

<p>"My name is Faustina Banti," she said,
looking at him with her great eyes; "but
you may call me 'Tina,' if you like. I
had a little brother once who called me
that. He died."</p>

<p>"You are so very kind to me, Tina,"
said the boy, "I am sure you must be very
good."</p>

<p>She looked at him again, smiling.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<h2>IV.</h2>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">The</span> next morning early Mark was sent
for to the Prince. He was shown into the
dressing-room, but the Prince was already
dressed. He was seated in an easy-chair
reading a small closely-printed sheet of
paper, upon which the word "Wien" was
conspicuous to the boy. The Prince bade
the little schoolmaster be seated on a
fauteuil near him, and looked so kindly
that he felt quite at his ease.</div>

<p>"Well! little one," said the Prince,
"how findest thou thyself? Hast thou
found any friends yet in this place?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>"The Signorina has been very kind to
me, Highness," said the boy.</p>

<p>"Ah!" said the Prince, smiling, "thou
hast found that out already. That is not so
bad. I thought you two would be friends.
What has the Signorina told thee?"</p>

<p>"She has told me of the actors who are
so clever and so strange. She says that
they are all in love with her."</p>

<p>"That is not unlikely. And what else?"</p>

<p>"She has told me of the Princess and
of her servente."</p>

<p>"Indeed!" said the Prince, with the
slightest possible appearance of increased
interest; "what does she say of the
Princess?"</p>

<p>"She says that she is a bad woman, and
that she hates her."</p>

<p>"Ah! the Signorina appears to have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
formed opinions of her own, and to be able
to express them. What else?"</p>

<p>"She says that the servente is the devil
himself! But she does not mean the real
devil. She says that the servente is a
much more real devil than he! Is not that
horrible, Highness?"</p>

<p>The Prince looked at Mark for two or
three moments, with a kindly but strange
far-reaching look, which struck the boy,
though he did not in the least understand
it.</p>

<p>"I did well, little one," he said at last,
"when I sent for thee."</p>

<p>There was a pause. The Prince seemed
to have forgotten the presence of the boy,
who already was sufficiently of a courtier to
hold his tongue.</p>

<p>At last the Prince spoke.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>"And the children," he said; "thou
hast seen them?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Mark, with a little shy
smile, "I did badly there. I insulted the
gracious Fr&auml;ulein by calling her 'Princess,'
which she said only the little Princes should
do; and I told her I was come to teach
her and her little brother, and that I should
do it in my own way or not at all."</p>

<p>The Prince looked as though he feared
that this unexpected amusement would be
almost too delightful.</p>

<p>"Well, little one," he said, "thou hast
begun well. Better than this none could
have done. Only be careful that thou art
not spoilt. Care nothing for what thou
hearest here. Continue to hate and fear
the devil; for, whether he be thy own
devil or the servente, he is more powerful<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
than thou. Say nothing but what He
whom thou rightly callest God teaches
thee to say. So all will be well. Better
teacher than thou my daughter could not
have. I would wish her to be pious, within
reason; not like her aunt, that would not
be well. I should wish her to care for the
poor. Nothing is so gracious in noble
ladies as to care for the poor. When they
cease to do this they lose tone at once.
The French noblesse have done so. I
should like her to visit the poor herself.
It will have the best effect upon her nature;
much better," continued the Prince with a
half smile, and seemingly speaking to himself,
"much better, I should imagine, than
on the poor themselves. But what will
you have?&mdash;some one must suffer, and the
final touch cannot be obtained without."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>There was another pause. This aspect
of the necessary suffering the poor had to
undergo was so new to Mark that he
required some time to grasp it. The visits
of noble ladies to his village had not been
so frequent as to cause the malign effects
to be deeply felt.</p>

<div class='center'><b>*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *</b></div>

<p>Acting upon this advice so far as he
understood it, Mark pursued the same
system of education with the little Highnesses
as he had followed with the village
children; that is, he set them to read such
things as he was told they ought to learn,
and encouraged them to do so by promising
to relate his histories and tales if they were
good.</p>

<p>It is surprising how much the same
human nature remains after generations of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
different breeding and culture. It is true
that these princely children had heard
many tales before, perhaps the very ones
the little schoolmaster now related, yet
they delighted in nothing so much as hearing
them again. Much of this pleasure, no
doubt, was due to the intense faith and
interest in them shown by Mark himself.
He talked to them also much about God
and the unseen world of angels, and of the
wicked one; and, as they believed firmly
that he was an angel, they listened to these
things with the more ready belief. Indeed,
the affection which the little boy formed
for his child-tutor was unusual. He was
a silent, solemn child; he said nothing, but
he attached himself to Mark with a persistent
devotion.</p>

<p>Every one in the palace, indeed, took to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
the boy: the pages left off teasing him; the
Signorina petted him in a manner sufficient
to deprive her numerous lovers of their
reason; the servants waited on him for
love and not for reward; but the strangest
thing of all was, that in proportion as he
was kindly treated&mdash;just as much as every
one seemed to love him and delight in
him&mdash;just so much did the boy become
miserable and unhappy. The kinder
these people were, the more he felt
the abyss which lay between his soul
and theirs; earnestness and solemn faith
in his&mdash;sarcasm and lively farce, and, at
the most, kindly toleration of belief, in
theirs.</p>

<p>Had they ill-treated or wronged him,
he would not have felt it so much; but
kindness and security on their part, seemed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
to intensify the sense of doubt and perplexity
on his.</p>

<p>It is difficult to realise the effect which
sarcasm and irony have upon such natures
as his. They look upon life with such a
single eye. It is so beautiful and solemn
to them. Truth is so true; they are so
much in earnest that they cannot understand
the complex feeling that finds relief
in sarcasm and allegory, that tolerates
the frivolous and the vain, as an ironic
reading of the lesson of life.</p>

<p>The actors were particularly kind to
him, though their grotesque attempts to
amuse him mostly added to his misery.
They were extremely anxious that he
should appear upon the stage, and indeed
the boy's beauty and simplicity would have
made an excellent foil.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>"Herr Tutor," said old Carricchio the
arlecchino to him one day, with mock
gravity, "we are about to perform a comedy&mdash;what
is called a masqued comedy, not
because we wear masques, for we don't,
but because of our dresses. It consists of
music, dancing, love-making, joking, and
buffoonery; you will see what a trifle it is
all about. The scene is in the garden of
a country-house&mdash;during what in Italy we
call the Villeggiatura, that is the month we
spend in the country during the vintage.
A lady's fan is found by an ill-natured person
in a curious place; all the rest agree
not to see the fan, not to acknowledge that
it is a fan. It is all left to us at the moment,
all except the songs and the music,
and you know how delightful those are.
If you would take a part, and keep your<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
own character throughout, it would be
magnificent; but we will wait, if you once
see it you will wish to act."</p>

<p>No one, indeed, was kinder to Mark,
or seemed more to delight in his society
than the old arlecchino, and the two made
a most curious sight, seated together on
one of the terraces on a sunny afternoon.
Nothing could be more diverse in appearance
than this strangely assorted pair. Carricchio
was tall, with long limbs, and large
aquiline features. He wore a set smile upon
his large expressive mouth, which seemed
born of no sense of enjoyment, but of an
infinite insight, and of a mocking friendliness.
He seldom wore anything but the
dress of his part; but he wrapped himself
mostly in a long cloak, lined with fur, for
even the northern sunshine seemed chilly to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
the old clown. Wrapped in this ancient
garment, he would sit beside Mark, listening
to the boy's stories with his deep unfathomed
smile; and as he went on with
his histories, the boy used to look into his
companion's face, wondering at the slow
smile, and at the deep wrinkles of the worn
visage, till at length, fascinated at the sight,
he forgot his stories, and looking into the
old man's face appeared to Mark, though
the comparison seems preposterous, like
gazing at the fated story of the mystic
tracings of the star-lit skies.</p>

<p>Why the old man listened so patiently
to these childish stories no one could tell;
perhaps he did not hear them. He himself
said that the presence of Mark had the
effect of music upon his jaded and worn
sense. But, indeed, there was beneath<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
Carricchio's mechanical buffoonery and
farce a sober and pathetic humour, which
was almost unconscious, and which was
now, probably owing to advancing years,
first becoming known either to himself or
others.</p>

<p>"The Maestro has been talking to me
this morning," he said one day. "He says
that life is a wretched masque, a miserable
apology for existence by the side of art;
what do you say to that?"</p>

<p>"I do not know what it means," said
Mark; "I neither know life nor art, how
can I tell?"</p>

<p>"That is true, but you know more than
you think. The Maestro means that life
is imperfect, struggling, a failure, ugly most
often; art is perfect, complete, beautiful,
and full of force and power. But I tell<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
him that some failure is better than success;
sometimes ugliness is a finer thing than
beauty; and that the best art is that which
only reproduces life. If life were fashioned
after the most perfect art you would never
be able to cry, nor to make me cry, as you
do over your beautiful tales."</p>

<p>Mark tried to understand this, but
failed, and was therefore silent. Indeed it
is not certain whether Carricchio himself
understood what he was saying.</p>

<p>He seemed to have some suspicion of
this, for he did not go on talking, but was
silent for some time. These silences were
common between the two.</p>

<p>At last he said:</p>

<p>"I think where the Maestro is wrong is
in making the two quarrel. They cannot
quarrel. There is no art without life, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
no life without art. Look at a puppet-play&mdash;the
fantoccini&mdash;it means life and it means
art."</p>

<p>"I never saw a puppet-play," said Mark.</p>

<p>"Well, you have seen us," said Carricchio;
"we are much the same. We move
ourselves&mdash;they are moved by wires; but
we do just the same things&mdash;we are life and
we are art, in the burletta we are both.
I often think which is which&mdash;which is the
imposture and which is the masque. Then
I think that somewhere there must be a
higher art that surpasses the realism of
life&mdash;a divine art which is not life but
fashions life.</p>

<p>"When I look at you, little one," Carricchio
went on, "I feel almost as I do
when the violins break in upon the jar and
fret of the wittiest dialogue. Jest and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
lively fancy&mdash;these are the sweets of life,
no doubt&mdash;and humorous thought and
speech and gesture&mdash;but they are not
this divine art, they are not rest. They
shrivel and wither the brain. The whole
being is parched, the heart is dry in this
sultry, piercing light. But when the stringed
melodies steal in, and when the rippling,
surging arpeggios and crescendos sweep in
upon the sense, and the stilled cadences
that lull and soothe&mdash;then, indeed, it is like
moisture and the gracious dew. It is like
sleep; the strained nerves relax; the overwrought
frame, which is like dry garden
mould, is softened, and the flowers spring
up again."</p>

<p>Carricchio paused; but as Mark said
nothing, he went on again.</p>

<p>"The other life is gay, lively, bright,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
full of excitement and interest, of tender
pity even, and of love&mdash;but this is rest
and peace. The other is human life, but
what is this? Art? Ah! but a divine
art. Here is no struggle, no selfish desire,
no striving, no conflict of love or of hate.
It is like silence, the most unselfish thing
there is. I have, indeed, sometimes
thought that music must be the silence
of heaven."</p>

<p>"The silence of heaven!" said Mark,
with open eyes. "The silence of heaven!
What, then, are its words?"</p>

<p>"Ah! that," said the old clown, smiling,
but with a sad slowness in his speech, "is
beyond me to tell. I can hear its silence,
but not its voice."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<h2>V.</h2>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">The</span> private theatre in the palace was a
room of very moderate size, for the audience
was necessarily very small; in fact, the
stage was larger than the auditorium.
The play took place in the afternoon, and
there was no artificial light; many of the
operatic performances in Italy, indeed, took
place in the open air.</div>

<p>Yet, though the time of day and the
natural light deprived the theatre of much
of the strangeness and glamour with which
it is usually associated, and which so much
impress a youth who sees it for the first<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
time, the effect of the first performance
upon Mark was very remarkable. He
was seated immediately behind the Prince.
Far from being delighted with the play, he
was overpowered as it went on by an intense
melancholy horror. When the violins,
the flutes, and the fifes began the overture,
a new sense seemed given to him, which
was not pleasure but the intensest dread.
If the singing of the Signorina had been a
shock to him, accustomed as he was only to
the solemn singing of his childhood, what
must this elfish, weird, melodious music
have seemed, full of gay and careless life,
and of artless unconscious airs which yet
were miracles of art? He sat, terrified at
these delicious sounds, as though this world
of music without thought or conscience
were a wicked thing. The shrill notes of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
the fifes, the long tremulous vibration of
the strings, seemed to draw his heart after
them. Wherever this wizard call might
lead him it seemed he would have to follow
the alluring chords.</p>

<p>But when the acting began his terror
became more intense. The grotesque
figures seemed to him those of devils, or
at the best of fantastic imps or gnomes.
He could understand nothing of the dialogue,
but the gestures, the laughter, the
wild singing, were shocking to him. When
the Signorina appeared, the strange intensity
of her colour, the brilliancy of her eyes,
and what seemed to him the freedom of
her gestures and the boldness of her bewitching
glances, far from delighting, as
they seemed to do all the others, made
him ready to weep with shame and grief.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
He sank back in his seat to avoid the
notice of the Prince, who, indeed, was too
much absorbed in the music and the acting
to remember him.</p>

<p>The beauty of the music only added to
his despair; had it been less lovely, had
the acting not forced now and then a glance
of admiring wonder or struck a note of
high-toned touching pathos even, it would
not all have seemed so much the work of
evil. When the comedy was over he crept
silently away to his room; and in the
excitement of congratulation and praise, as
actors and audience mingled together, and
the Signorina was receiving the commendations
of the Prince, he was not missed.</p>

<p>He could not stay in this place&mdash;that at
least was clear to him. He must escape.
He must return to nature, to the woods<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
and birds, to children and to children's
sports. These gibing grimaces, these endless
bowings and scrapings and false compliments,
known of all to be false, would
choke him if he stayed. He must escape
from the house of frivolity into the soft,
gracious outer air of sincerity and truth.</p>

<p>He cried himself to sleep: all through
the night, amid fitful slumber, the crowd
of masques jostled and mocked at him;
the weird strains of unknown instruments
reached his half-conscious bewildered sense.
Early in the morning he awoke. There
had been rain in the night, and the smiling
morning beckoned him out.</p>

<p>He stole down some back stairs, and
found a door which opened on gardens and
walks at the back of the palace. This he
managed to open, and went out.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>The path on which the door opened led
him through rows of fruit-trees and young
plantations. A little forest of delicate
boughs and young leaves lifted itself up
against the blue sky, and a myriad drops
sparkled in the morning sun. The fresh
cool air, the blue sky, the singing of the
birds, restored Mark to himself. He
seemed to see again the possibility of
escape from evil, and the hope of righteousness
and peace. His whole spirit went
out in prayer and love to the Almighty,
who had made these lovely things. He
felt as he had been wont to do when, on
a fine Sunday, he had walked home with
his children in order, relating to them the
most beautiful tales of God. He wandered
slowly down the narrow paths. The fresh-turned
earth between the rows of saplings,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
the beds of herbs, the moist grass, gave
forth a scent at once delicate and searching.
The boy's cheerfulness began to return.
The past seemed to fade. He almost
thought himself the little schoolmaster
again.</p>

<p>After wandering for some time through
this delicious land of perfume, of light, and
sweet sound, he came to a very long but
narrow avenue of old elm trees that led
down a gradual slope, as it seemed, into
the heart of the forest. Beneath the
avenue a well-kept path seemed to point
with a guiding hand.</p>

<p>He followed the path for some distance,
and had just perceived what seemed to be
an old manor-house, standing in a courtyard
at the farther end, when he was
conscious of a figure advancing along the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
path to meet him: as it approached he
saw that it was that of a lady of tall and
commanding appearance, and apparently
of great beauty; she wore the dress of
some sisterhood. When he was near enough
to see her face he found that it was indeed
beautiful, with an expression of the purest
sincerity and benevolence. The lady
stopped and spoke to Mark at once.</p>

<p>"You must be the new tutor to their
Highnesses," she said; "I have heard of
you."</p>

<p>Mark said that he was.</p>

<p>"You do not look well," said the lady,
very kindly; "are you happy at the
palace?"</p>

<p>"Are you the Princess Isoline?" said
Mark, not answering the question; "I
think you must be, you are so beautiful."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>"I am the Princess Isoline," said the
lady; "walk a little way with me."</p>

<p>Mark turned with the lady and walked
back towards the palace. After a moment
or two he said: "I am not happy at
Joyeuse, I am very miserable, I want to
run away."</p>

<p>"What makes you so unhappy? Are
they not kind to you? The Prince is very
kind, and the children are good children&mdash;I
have always thought."</p>

<p>"They are all very kind, too kind to
me," said the boy. "I cannot make you
understand why I am so miserable, I cannot
tell myself&mdash;the Prince is worse than
all&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Why is the Prince the worst of all?"
said the lady, in a very gentle voice.</p>

<p>"All the rest I know are wrong,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
replied the boy, passionately&mdash;"the actors,
the Signorina, the pages, and all; but when
the Prince looks at me with his quiet
smile&mdash;when the look comes into his eyes
as though he could see through time even
into eternity&mdash;when he looks at me in
his kindly, pitying way&mdash;I begin to
doubt. Oh, Highness, it is terrible to
doubt! Do you think that the Prince is
right?"</p>

<p>The Princess was silent for a moment
or two; it was not that she did not
understand the boy, for she understood
him very well.</p>

<p>"No, I think you are right and not the
Prince," she said at length, in her quiet
voice.</p>

<p>There was a pause: neither seemed to
know what to say next. They had now<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
nearly reached the end of the avenue next
the palace; the Princess stopped.</p>

<p>"Come back with me," she said, "I
will show you my house."</p>

<p>They walked slowly along the narrow
pathway towards the old house at the
farther end. The Princess was evidently
considering what to say.</p>

<p>"Why do you know that they are all
wrong?" she said at last.</p>

<p>"Highness," said the boy after a pause,
"I have never lived amongst, or seen
anything, since I was born, but what was
natural and real&mdash;the forest, the fruit-trees
in blossom, the gardens, and the flowers.
I have never heard anything except of
God&mdash;of the wretchedness of sin&mdash;of
beautiful stories of good people. My
grandfather, when he was alive, used to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
talk to me, as I sat with him at his charcoal-burning
in the forest, of my forefathers
who were all honest and pious people.
There are not many Princes who can say
that."</p>

<p>The Princess did not seem to notice
this last uncourtly speech.</p>

<p>"'I shall then find all my forefathers in
Heaven,' I would say to him," continued
Mark. "'Yes, that thou wilt! we shall
then be of high nobility. Do not lose this
privilege.' If I lose this privilege, how
sad that will be! But here, in the palace,
they think nothing of these things&mdash;instead
of hymns they sing the strangest, wildest
songs, so strange and beautiful that I fear
and tremble at them as if the sounds were
wicked sounds."</p>

<p>So talking, the Princess and the boy went<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
on through the lovely wood; at last they
left the avenue and passed into the courtyard
of a stately but decayed house. The
walls of the courtyard were overgrown
with ivy, and trees were growing up against
the house and shading some of the windows.
The Princess passed on without speaking,
and entered the hall by an open door. As
they entered, Mark could hear the sound of
looms, and inside were several men and
women at different machines employed in
weaving cloth. The Princess spoke to
several, and leading Mark onward she
ascended a wide staircase, and reached at
last a long gallery at the back of the
house. Here were many looms, and girls
and men employed in weaving. The long
range of lofty windows faced the north,
and over the nearer woods could be seen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
the vast sweep of the great Thuringian
Forest, where Martin Luther had lived
and walked. The risen sun was gilding
the distant woods. A sense of indescribable
loveliness and peace seemed to Mark
to pervade the place.</p>

<p>"How happy you must be here, gracious
Highness!" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>They were standing apart in one of
the windows towards the end of the long
room, and the noise of the looms made
a continuous murmur that prevented their
voices being heard by the others who were
near.</p>

<p>The Princess looked at Mark for some
moments without reply.</p>

<p>"I must speak the truth always," she
said at last, "but more than ever to such
as thou art. I am not happy."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>The boy looked at her as though his
heart would break.</p>

<p>"Not happy," he said in a low voice,
"and you so good."</p>

<p>"The good are not happy," said the
Princess, "and the happy are not good."</p>

<p>There was a pause; then the Princess
went on:</p>

<p>"The people who are with me are
good, but they are not happy. They have
left the world and its pleasures, but they
regret them; they live in the perpetual
consciousness of this self-denial&mdash;this fancy
that they are serving God better than
others are; they are in danger of becoming
jealous and hypocritical. I warn
you never to join a particular society which
proposes, as its object, to serve God better
than others. You are safer, more in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
way of serving God in the palace, even
amid the singing and the music which
seems to you so wicked. They are happy;
they are thoughtless, gay, like the birds.
They have at least no dark gloomy
thoughts of God, even if they have no
thoughts of Him at all. They may be
won to Him, nay, they may be nearer to
Him now than some who think themselves
so good. Since I began this way of life
I have heard of many such societies,
which have crumbled into the dust with
derision, and are remembered only with
reproach."</p>

<p>Mark stood gazing at the distant forest
without seeing it. He did not know what
to think.</p>

<p>"I do not know why I have told you
this," said the Princess; "I had no thought<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
of saying such words when I brought you
here. I seem to have spoken them without
willing it. Perhaps it was the will of
God."</p>

<p>"Why do you go on with this life," said
Mark sadly, "if it be not good? The
Prince would be glad if you would come
back to the palace. He has told me
so."</p>

<p>It seemed to the boy that life grew
more and more sad. It seemed that, baffled
and turned back at every turn, there was
no reality, no sincere walk anywhere possible.
The worse seemed everywhere the
better, the children of this world everywhere
wiser than the children of light.</p>

<p>"I cannot go back now," said the
Princess. "When you are gone I shall forget
this; I shall think otherwise. There<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
is something in your look that has made
me speak like this."</p>

<p>"Then are these people really not
happy?" said Mark again.</p>

<p>"Why should they be happy?" said the
Princess, with some bitterness in her voice.
"They have given up all that makes life
pleasant&mdash;fine clothes, delicate food, cunning
harmonies, love, gay devices, and sports.
Why should they be happy? They
have dull work, none to amuse or enliven
the long days."</p>

<p>"I was very happy in my village outside
the palace gates," said Mark quietly;
"I had none of these things; I only taught
the little peasants, yet I was happy. From
morning to night the path was straight
before me,&mdash;a bright and easy path;
and the end was always light. Now all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
is difficult and strange. Since I passed
through the gates with the golden scrolls,
which I thought were like the heavenly
Jerusalem, all goes crooked and awry;
nothing seems plain and righteous as in
the pleasant old days. I have come into
an enchanted palace, the air of which I
cannot breathe and live; I must go back."</p>

<p>"No, not so," said the Princess, "you
are wanted here. Where you were you
were of little good. There were at least
others who could do your work. Here
none can do it but you. They never saw
any one like you before. They know it
and speak of it. All are changed somewhat
since you came; you might, it is true,
come to me, but I should not wish it.
The air of this house would be worse for
you even than that of the palace which you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
fear so much. Besides, the Prince would
not be pleased with me."</p>

<p>Mark looked sadly before him for some
moments before he said:</p>

<p>"Even if it be true what you say, still I
must go. It is killing me. I wish to do
right and good to all; but what good
shall I do if it takes all my strength and
life? I shall ask the Prince to let me go
back."</p>

<p>"No," said the Princess, "not that&mdash;never
that. It is impossible, you cannot
go back!"</p>

<p>"Cannot go back!" cried Mark.
"Why? The Prince is very kind. He
will not keep me here to die."</p>

<p>"Yes, the Prince is very kind, but he
cannot do that; what is passed can never
happen again. It is the children's phrase,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
'Do it again.' It can never be done again.
You have passed, as you say, the golden
gates into an enchanted world; you have
known good and evil; you have tasted of
the fruit of the so-called Tree of Life;
you cannot go back to the village. Think."</p>

<p>Mark was silent for a longer space this
time. His eyes were dim, but he seemed
to see afar off.</p>

<p>"No," he said at last, "it is true, I
cannot go back. The village, and the
school, and the children have passed away.
I should not find them there, as they were
before. If I cannot come to you, there is
nothing for me but to die."</p>

<p>"The Pagans," said the Princess, "the
old Pagans, that knew their gods but dimly,
used to say&mdash;"The God-beloved die
young." It has been said since by Christian<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
men.&mdash;Do not be afraid to die. Instead
of your form and voice there will be
remembrance and remorse; instead of indifference
and sarcasm there will be contrition;
in place of thoughtless kindliness
a tender love. Do not be afraid to die.
The charm is working now; it will increase
when sight is changed for memory, and the
changeful irritation of time for changeless
recollection and regret. The body
of the sown grain is transfigured into
the flower of a spiritual life, and from
the dust is raised a mystic presence
which can never fade. Do not be afraid
to die."</p>

<p>Mark walked slowly back to the palace.
He could not think; he was stunned and
bewildered. He wished the Princess
Isoline would have let him come to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
her. Then he thought all might yet
be well. When he reached the palace
he found everything in confusion. The
Princess and her friend the <i>servente</i> had
suddenly arrived.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>VI.</h2>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">Later</span> on in the day Mark was told that
the Princess wished to see him, and that
he must wait upon her in her own apartment.
He was taken to a part of the
palace into which he had hitherto never
been; in which a luxurious suite of rooms
was reserved for the Princess when she
condescended to occupy them. The most
easterly of the suite was a morning sitting-room,
which opened upon a balcony or
trellised verandah, shaded with jasmine.
The room was furnished in a very different
style from the rest of the palace. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
other rooms, though rich, were rather bare
of garniture, after the Italian manner&mdash;their
ornaments consisting of cabinets of
inlaid wood and pictures on the walls, with
the centre of the room left clear. These
rooms on the contrary, were full of small
gilt furniture, after the fashion of the French
court. Curious screens, depicting strange
birds of gaudy plumage, embarrassed Mark
as he entered the room.</div>

<p>The Prince was seated near a lady who
was reclining in the window, and opposite
to them was a stranger whom Mark knew
must be the Count. The lady was beautiful,
but with a kind of beauty strange to
the boy, and her dress was more wonderful
than any he had yet seen, though it was a
mere morning robe. She looked curiously
at him as he entered the room.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>"This, then," she said, "is the clown
who is to educate my children."</p>

<p>At this not very encouraging address
the boy stopped, and stood silently contemplating
the group.</p>

<p>The Count was the first who came to
his assistance.</p>

<p>"The youth is not so bad, Princess," he
said. "He has an air of society about
him, in spite of his youth."</p>

<p>The Prince looked at the Count with a
pleased expression.</p>

<p>"Do not fear for the children, Adelaide,"
he said; "they will fare very well. Their
manners are improved already. When they
come to Vienna you will see how fine their
breeding will be thought to be. Leave
them to me. You do not care for them;
leave them to me and to the Herr Tutor."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>Mark was looking at the Count. This
was another strange study for the boy.
He was older than the Prince&mdash;a man of
about forty; more firmly built, and with
well-cut but massive features. He wore a
peruke of very short, curled hair; his
dress was rich, but very simple; and his
whole appearance and manner suggested
curiously that of a man who carried no
more weight than he could possibly help,
who encumbered himself with nothing that
he could throw aside, who offered in every
action, speech, and gesture the least possible
resistance to the atmosphere, moral, social,
or physical, in which he found himself.
His manner to the Prince was deferential,
without being marked, and he evidently
wished to propitiate him.</p>

<p>"Thou art very pious, I hear," said the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
Princess, addressing Mark in a tone of
unmitigated contempt.</p>

<p>The boy only bowed.</p>

<p>"Is he dumb?" said the Princess, still
with undisguised disdain.</p>

<p>"No," said the Prince quietly. "He
can speak when he thinks that what he
says will be well received."</p>

<p>"He is wise," said the Count.</p>

<p>"Well," said the Princess sharply, "my
wishes count for nothing; of that we are
well aware. But I do not want my children
to be infected with the superstitions
of the past, which still linger among the
coarse and ignorant peasantry. I suppose,
now, this peasant schoolmaster believes in
a God and a hell, and in a heaven for
such as he?" and she threw herself back
with a light laugh.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, surely," said the Count blandly,
"that were too gross, even for a peasant
priest."</p>

<p>"Tell me, Herr Tutor," said the Princess;
and now she threw a nameless charm
into her manner as she addressed the boy,
from whom she wished an answer; "tell
me, dost thou believe in a heaven?"</p>

<p>"Yes, gracious Highness," said Mark.</p>

<p>"It has always struck me," said the
Prince, with a philosophic air, "that we
might leave the poor their distant heaven.
Its existence cannot injure us. I have
sometimes fancied that they might retort
upon me: 'You have everything here that
life can wish: we have nothing. You have
dainty food, and fine clothes, and learning,
and music, and all the fruition that your
fastidious fancy craves: we are cold and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
hungry, and ignorant and miserable. Leave
us our heaven! At least, if you do not
believe in it, keep silence before us. Our
belief does not trouble you; it takes
nothing from the least of your pleasures;
it is all we have.'"</p>

<p>"When the Prince begins to preach,"
said the Princess, with scarcely less contempt
than she had shown for Mark, "I
always leave the room."</p>

<p>The Count immediately rose and opened
a small door leading to a boudoir. The
Prince rose and bowed. The Princess
swept to the ground before him in an
elaborate curtsey, and, looking contemptuously,
yet with a certain amused interest,
at Mark, left the room.</p>

<p>The Prince resumed his seat, and, leaning
back, looked from one to the other of his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
companions. He was really thinking with
amusement what a so strangely-assorted
couple might be likely to say to each other;
but the Count, misled by his desire to please
the Prince, misunderstood him. He supposed
that he wished that the conversation
which the Princess had interrupted should
be continued, and, sitting down, he began
again.</p>

<p>"I suppose, Herr Tutor," he said, "you
propose to train your pupils so that they
shall be best fitted to mingle with the
world in which they will be called upon
to play an important part?"</p>

<p>The Prince motioned to Mark to sit,
which he did, upon the edge of an embroidered
couch.</p>

<p>"If the serene Highness," he said,
"had wished for one to teach his children<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
who knew the great world and the cities
he would not have sent for me."</p>

<p>"What do you teach them, then?"</p>

<p>"I tell them beautiful histories," said
Mark, "of good people, and of love, and
of God."</p>

<p>"It has been proved," said the Count,
"that there is no God."</p>

<p>"Then there is still love," said the boy.</p>

<p>"Yes, there is still love," said the Count,
with an amused glance at the Prince; "all
the more that we have got rid of a cruel
God."</p>

<p>The boy's face flushed.</p>

<p>"How can you dare say that?" he said.</p>

<p>"Why," said the Count, with a simulated
warmth, "what is the God of you
pious people but a cruel God? He who
condemns the weak and the ignorant&mdash;the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
weak whom He has Himself made weak,
and the ignorant whom He keeps in darkness&mdash;to
an eternity of torture for a trivial
and temporary, if not an unconscious, fault?
What is that God but cruel who will not
forgive till He has gratified His revenge
upon His own Son? What is that God
but cruel&mdash;&mdash; But I need not go on. The
whole thing is nothing but a figment and a
dream, hatched in the diseased fancies of
half-starved monks dying by inches in caves
and deserts, terrified by the ghastly visions
of a ruined body and a disordered mind&mdash;men
so stupid and so wicked that they
could not discern the nature of the man
whom they professed to take for their God&mdash;a
man, apparently, one of those rare
natures, in advance of their time, whom
friends and enemies alike misconceive and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
thwart; and who die, as He died, helpless
and defeated, with a despairing cry to a
heedless or visionary God in whom they
have believed in vain."</p>

<p>As the Count went on, a new and terrible
phase of experience was passing
through Mark's mind. As the brain consists
of two parts, so the mind seems dual
also. Thought seems at different times to
consist of different phases, each of which
can only see itself&mdash;of a faith that can see
no doubt&mdash;of a doubt that can conceive
of no certainty; one week exalted to the
highest heaven, the next plunged into the
lowest hell. For the first time in his life
this latter phase was passing through Mark's
mind. What had always looked to him as
certain as the hills and fields, seemed, on
a sudden, shrunken and vanished away.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
His mind felt emptied and vacant; he
could not even think of God. It appeared
even marvellous to him that anything could
have filled this vast fathomless void, much
less such a lovely and populous world as
that which now seemed vanished as a
morning mist. He tried to rouse his
energies, to grasp at and to recover his
accustomed thoughts, but he seemed fascinated;
the eyes of the Count rested on
him, as he thought, with an evil glance.
He turned faint.</p>

<p>But the Prince came to his aid. He
was looking across at the Count with a
sort of lazy dislike; as one looks at a
stuffed reptile or at a foul but caged bird.</p>

<p>"Thou art soon put down, little one,"
he said, with his kindly, lofty air. "Tell him
all this is nothing to thee! That disease<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
and distraction never created anything.
That nothing lives without a germ of life.
Tell the Count that thou art not careful to
answer him&mdash;that it may be as he says.
Tell him that even were it so&mdash;that He of
whom he speaks died broken-hearted in
that despairing cry to the Father who
He thought had deserted Him&mdash;tell the
Count thou art still with Him! Tell him
that if His mission was misconceived and
perverted, it was because His spirit and
method was Divine! Tell the Count that
in spite of failure and despair, nay, perchance&mdash;who
knows?&mdash;because even of
that despair, He has drawn all men to
Him from that cross of His as He said.
Tell the Count that He has ascended to
His Father and to thy Father, and, alone
among the personalities of the world's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
story, sits at the right hand of God! Tell
him this, he will have nothing to reply."</p>

<p>And, as if to render reply impossible,
the Prince rose and, calling to his spaniel,
who came at his gesture from the sunshine
in the window, he struck a small Indian
gong upon the table, and the pages drawing
back the curtains of the antechamber,
he left the room.</p>

<p>The Count looked at the boy with a
smile. Mark's face was flushed, his eyes
sparkling and full of tears.</p>

<p>"Well, Herr Tutor," said the Count
not unkindly, "dost thou say all that?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said the boy, "God helping me,
I say all that!"</p>

<p>"Thou might'st do worse, Tutor," said
the Count, "than follow the Prince."</p>

<p>And he too left the room.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<h2>VII.</h2>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">The</span> arrival of the Princess very much
increased the gaiety and activity of life
within the palace. Every one became
impressed with the idea that the one thing
necessary was to entertain her. The actors
set to work to prepare new plays, new
spectacles; the musicians to compose new
combinations of quaint notes; the poets
new sonnets on strange and, if possible,
new conceits. As the Princess was very
difficult to please, and as it was almost
impossible to conceive anything which
appeared new to her jaded intellect, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
difficulty of the task caused any idea that
promised novelty to be seized upon with
a desperate determination. The most
favourite one still continued to be the
proposition that Mark should be induced,
by fair means or foul, to take a part upon
the stage. His own character&mdash;the <i>r&ocirc;le</i>
which he instinctively played&mdash;was so absolutely
original and fresh that the universal
opinion was confident of the success of
such a performance.</div>

<p>"By some means or other," said old
Carricchio, "he must be got to act."</p>

<p>"You may do what you will with him,"
said the Signorina sadly; "he will die.
He is too good to live. Like my little
brother and the poor canary, he will die."</p>

<p>In pursuit, then, of this ingenious plan,
the Princess was requested to honour with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
her presence a performance of a hitherto
unknown character, to be given in the
palace gardens. She at first declined,
saying that she had seen everything that
could be performed so often that she was
sick of such things, and that each of their
vaunted and promised novelties proved
more stale and dull than its precursor. It
was therefore necessary to let her know
something of what was proposed; and no
sooner did she understand that Mark was
to be the centre round which the play
turned, than she entered into the plot with
the greatest zeal.</p>

<p>It is, perhaps, not strange that to such
a woman Mark's character and personality
offered a singular novelty and even charm.
The thought of triumphing over this child-like
innocence, of contrasting it with the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
licence and riot which the play would offer,
struck her jaded curiosity with a sense of
delicious freshness, and she took an eager
delight in the arrangement and contrivance
of the scenes.</p>

<p>In expansion of the idea suggested by
some of the wonderful theatres in Italy,
where the open-air stage extended into
real avenues and thickets, it was decided
that the entire play should be represented
in the palace gardens: and that, in fact,
the audience should take part in the action
of the drama. This, where the whole
household was theatrical, and where the
actors were trained in the Italian comedy,
which left so much to the <i>improvisatore</i>&mdash;to
the individual taste and skill of the
actor&mdash;was a scheme not difficult to realise.</p>

<p>The palace garden, which was very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
large, was disposed in terraces and hedges;
it was planted with numerous thickets and
groves, and, wherever the inequalities of
the ground allowed it, with lofty banks of
thick shrubs crowned with young trees,
beneath which were arranged statues and
fountains in the Italian manner. The
hedges were cut into arcades and arches,
giving free access to the retired lawns and
shady nooks; and these arcades, and the
lofty groves and terraces, gave a constant
sense of mystery and expectation to the
scene. The ample lawns and open spaces
afforded more than one suitable stage,
upon which the most important scenes of
a play might be performed.</p>

<p>Beneath one of the highest and most
important banks, which stretched in a perfectly
straight line across the garden, planted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
thickly with flowering shrubs and fringed
at the top with a long line of young trees,
whose delicate foliage was distinct against
the sky, was placed the largest of the
fountains. It was copied from that in the
Piazza Santa Maria in Transtevere in
Rome, and was ornamented with great
shells, fish, and Tritons. On either side
of the fountain, and leading to the terrace
at the back, were flights of marble steps,
with wide-stretching stone bases upon either
side towering above the grass. In front
of the fountain and of the steps, beyond
a belt of greensward, were long hedges
planted in parallel rows, and connected
in arches and arcades, crossing and re-crossing
each other in an intricate maze,
so that a large company, wandering through
their paths, might suddenly appear and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
disappear. Beyond the hedges the lawn
stretched out again, broken by flowerbeds
and statues, and fringed by masses of foliage
and lofty limes. A sound of falling water
was heard on all sides; and, by mysterious
contrivance of concealed mechanism, flute
and harp music sounded from the depths
of the bosky groves.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Mark knew little of what was going on.
He occupied himself mostly with his
young pupils; but the conversation he
had had with the Princess Isoline had
troubled his mind, and a sense of perplexity
and of approaching evil weighed
upon his spirits and affected his health.
He, who had never known sickness in his
peasant life, now, when confined to a life
so unnatural and artificial, so out of harmony<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
with his mind and soul, became
listless and weak in body, and haunted by
fitful terrors and failings of consciousness.
He knew that some extraordinary preparations
were being made; but he was not
spoken to upon the subject, and paid little
attention to what was going on. Indeed,
had he been in the least of a suspicious
nature, the entire absence of solicitation or
interference might have led him to suspect
some secret machination against his simplicity
and peace, some contrived treachery
at work; but no such idea crossed his
mind, he occupied himself with his own
melancholy thoughts and with the histories
and parables which he related to his pupils.</p>

<p>On the morning of the day fixed for the
performance, then, things being in this
condition, Mark rose early. He had been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
informed that it was necessary that he
should wear his best court-suit, which we
have seen was of black silk with white
bands and ruffles. He gave his pupils a
short lesson, but their thoughts were so
much occupied by the expectation of the
coming festivity that he soon released them
and wandered out into the gardens alone.
The performance of the play had been fixed
for noon.</p>

<p>The day was bright and serene. The
gardens were brilliant with colour and sweet
with the perfume of flowers and herbs.
Strains of mysterious harmony from secret
music startled the wanderer along the paths.</p>

<p>Mark strayed listlessly through the more
distant groves. He was distressed and
dissatisfied with himself. His spirit seemed
to have lost its happy elasticity, his mind<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
its active joyousness. The things which
formerly delighted him no longer seemed
to please, even the loveliness of nature
was unable to arouse him. He found
himself envying those others who took so
much real delight, or seemed to him to do
so, in fantastic and frivolous music and
jest and comic sport. He began to wonder
what this new surprising play&mdash;these elaborately
prepared harmonies&mdash;these swells
and runs and shakes&mdash;might prove to be.
Then he hated himself for this envy&mdash;for
this curiosity. He wished to return to his
old innocence&mdash;his old simplicity.</p>

<p>But he felt that this could never be.
As the Princess had told him, whatever in
after years he might become, never would he
taste this delight of his child's nature again.
He was inexpressibly sad and depressed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>As he wandered on, not knowing where
he went, and growing almost stupid, and
indifferent even to pain, he found himself
suddenly surrounded by a throng of dancing
and laughing girls. It was easy, in
this magic garden, to steal unobserved upon
any one amid the bosky hedges and arcades;
but to surprise one so abstracted as the
dreamy and listless boy required no effort
at all. With hands clasped and mocking
laughter they surrounded the unhappy
Mark. They were masqued, with delicate
bits of fringed silk across the eyes, but had
they not been so he was too confused to
have recognised them. He tried in vain
to escape. Then he was lifted from the
ground by a score of hands and borne
rapidly away.</p>

<p>The stories of swan-maidens and winged<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
fairies of his old histories crossed his mind,
and he seemed to be flying through the
air; suddenly this strange flight came to
an end; he was on his feet again, and, as
he looked confusedly around, he found that
he was alone.</p>

<p>He was standing on a circular space of
lawn, surrounded by the lofty wood. In
the centre was an antique statue of a faun
playing upon a flute. He seemed to recognise
the scene, but could not in his
confusion recall in what part of the vast
garden it lay.</p>

<p>As he stood, lost in wonder and expectation,
a fairy-like figure was suddenly
present before him, from whence coming
he could not tell. The slim and delicate
form was dressed in a gossamer robe,
through which the lovely limbs might be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
seen. She held a light masque in her hand,
and laughed at him with her dancing eyes
and rosy mouth. It was the little Princess,
his pupil.</p>

<p>Even now no thought of plot or treachery
entered the boy's mind; he gazed at
her in wondering amaze.</p>

<p>"You must come with me," said the
girl-princess, holding out her hand; "I am
sent to fetch you to the under world."</p>

<p>Behind them as they stood, and facing
the statue of the faun, was a cave or hollow
in the wood, half concealed by the pendant
tendrils of creeping and flowering plants.
It seemed the opening of a subterranean
passage. The child pushed aside the
hanging blossoms and drew Mark, still
dazed and unresisting, after her. They
went down into the dark cave.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<div class='center'><b>*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *</b></div>

<p>Meanwhile from early dawn the palace
had been noisy with pattering feet. For
its bizarre population was augmented from
many sources, and the great performance
of the day taxed the exertions of all. As
the morning advanced visitors began to
arrive, and were marshalled to certain
parts of the gardens where positions were
allotted them, and refreshments served in
tents. They were mostly masqued. Then
strange groups began to form themselves
before the garden front of the palace, and
on the terraces. These were all masqued,
and dressed in variety of incongruous and
fantastic costumes, for though the play was
supposed to be classical, yet the necessity
of entertaining the Princess with something<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
startling and lively was more exacting than
artistic congruity. As we have seen, the
Prince had always inclined more to the fairy
and masqued comedy than to the serious
opera, and on this occasion the result was
more original and fantastic than had ever
before been achieved.</p>

<p>As the morning went on, there gradually
arranged itself, as if by fortuitous incident,
as strange a medley of fairy medi&aelig;val legend
and of classic lore as eye ever looked upon.
As the Prince and Princess, surrounded by
their principal guests, all masqued and
attired in every shade of colour and diversity
of form, stood upon the steps before
the palace, the wide gardens seemed full of
groups equally varied and equally brilliant
with their own. From behind the green
screens of the hedges, and from beneath<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
the arcades, figures were constantly emerging
and passing again out of sight,
apparently accidentally, but in fact with a
carefully-devised plan. Strains of delicate
music filled the air.</p>

<p>Then a group of girls in misty drapery,
and masqued across the eyes, the same
indeed that had carried off Mark, appeared
suddenly before the princely group. They
had discovered in the deepest dell of their
native mountain a deserted babe&mdash;the
offspring doubtless of the loves of some
wandering god. They were become its
nurses, and fed it upon sacred honey and
consecrated bread. Of immortal birth
themselves, and untouched by the passing
years, the boy became, as he grew up, the
plaything, and finally the beloved of his
beautiful friends. But the boy himself is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
indifferent to their attractions, and careless
or averse to their caresses. He is often
lost to them, and wanders in the mountain
fastnesses with the fawns and kids.</p>

<p>All this and more was told in action, in
song, and recitative, upon the palace lawns
before this strange audience, themselves
partly actors in the pastoral drama. Rural
dances, and games and sacrifices were presented
with delicately-conceived grouping
and pictorial effect. Then the main action
of the drama developed itself. The
most lovely of the nymphs, the queen and
leader of the rest, inspires a devoted passion
in the heart of the priest of Apollo, before
whose altar they offer sacrifice, and listen
for guiding and response. She rejects his
love with cruel contempt, pining always for
the coy and errant boy-god, who thinks of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
nothing but the distant mountain summits
and the divine whispers of the rustling
woods. The priest, insulted and enraged,
invokes the aid of his divinity, and a change
comes over the gay and magic scene.
A terrible pestilence strikes down the
inhabitants of these sylvan lawns, and
gloomy funerals, and the pathetic strains of
dirges take the place of dances and lively
songs.</p>

<p>The terrified people throw themselves
before the altar of the incensed Apollo, and
the god speaks again. His anger can be
appeased only by the sacrifice of the contemptuous
nymph who has insulted his
priest, or of some one who is willing to
perish in her place. Proclamation is made
across the sunny lawns, inviting a victim
who will earn the wreath of self-sacrifice<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
and of immortal consciousness of a great
deed, but there is no response.</p>

<p>The fatal day draws on; the altar of
sacrifice is prepared; but there spreads a
rumour among the crowd&mdash;fanned probably
by hope&mdash;that at the last moment a god
will interfere. Some even speak of the
wandering boy, if he could only be found.
Surely he&mdash;so removed from earthly and
selfish loves, so strange in his simplicity,
in his purity&mdash;surely he would lay down
his guileless life without a pang. Could he
only be found! or would he appear!</p>

<p>The herald's voice had died away for
the third time amid a fanfare of trumpets.
At the foot of the steps of the long terrace,
by the Roman fountain, a delicate and
lovely form stood on the grassy verge
before the altar, by the leaping and rushing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
water's side; a little to the left, whence the
road from Hades was supposed to come,
stood the divine messenger, the lofty
herald&mdash;clad in white, with a white wand;
behind the altar stood the wretched priest,
on whom the fearful task devolved, the
passion of terror, of pity, and of love, traced
upon his face; all sound of music had died
away; a hush as of death itself fell upon
the expectant crowd; from green arch and
trellised walk the throng of masques, actors
and spectators alike, pressed forward upon
the lawn before the altar.... The priest
tore the fillet from his brow and threw
down his knife.</p>

<div class='center'><b>*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *</b></div>

<p>The darkness of the cave gave place to
a burst of dazzling sunlight as Mark and
the little Princess, who in the darkness<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
had resumed her masque, came out suddenly
from the unseen opening upon one of the
great stone bases by the side of the steps.
To the boy's wonderstruck sense the flaring
light, the mystic and awful forms, the
thronged masques, the shock of surprise
and terror, fell with a stunning force. He
uttered a sharp cry like that of a snared
and harmless creature of the woods. He
pressed his hands before his face to shut
out the bewildering scene, and, stepping
suddenly backward in his surprise, fell
from the edge of the stone platform some
eight feet to the ground. A cry of natural
terror broke from the victim, in place of
the death-song she was expected to utter,
and she left her place and sprang forward
towards the steps. The crowd of masques
which surrounded the Prince came forward<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
tumultuously, and a hurried movement and
cry ran through the people, half of whom
were uncertain whether the settled order
of the play was interrupted or not.</p>

<p>Mark lay quite still on the grass, his
eyes closed, the Signorina bending over
him; but the herald, who was in fact
director of the play, waved his wand imperiously
before the masques, and they fell
back.</p>

<p>"Resume your place, Signorina," he
said, "this part of the play has, apparently,
failed. You will sing your death-song,
and the priest will offer himself in your
stead."</p>

<p>But the girl rose, and, forcing her way
to where the Prince stood, threw herself
upon his arm.</p>

<p>"Oh, stop it, Highness, stop it!" she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
cried, amid a passion of sobs; "he is dying,
do you not see!"</p>

<p>The Prince removed his masque; those
around him, following the signal, also
unmasqued, and the play was stopped.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<h2>I.</h2>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">There</span> was no change in the bright sunlight
or in the festive colours of the gay
crowd. The grass was as green, the sky
as blue, the rushing leaping water sparkled
as before, nevertheless a sudden change
and deadness fell upon the garden and its
throng of guests. The hush that had preceded
Mark's appearance was of a far
different kind. That had been a silence<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
of awe, of expectation, of excitement, and
of life; this was the scared silence of dismay.
Those who were most distant from
the Prince, and who could do so with
decency, began to scatter like frightened
children, and were lost in the arcaded
hedges and walks. The Prince remained
standing, his masque in his hand, the Signorina
still weeping on his arm; she was
too excited to admit of comfort, he stroked
her hand kindly, as he would that of a
child. The Herald, who was evidently
exceedingly disgusted at the turn things
had taken, and the quite unnecessary stop
that had been put to the play, had retired
a few paces, and was in conference with
Carricchio, who was apparently trying to
console him. The Princess, scared and
startled, was drawing the Count after her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
to leave the scene, when a tall and beautiful
woman emerged from a trellised walk
and, through the respectful crowd that
fell back to give her passage, advanced
towards the Prince.</div>

<p>"You may resume your play, Ferdinand,"
she said, and her voice was very sad
but without a touch of scorn; "you may
resume your play. It is not you who have
killed this child; it is I."</p>

<p>Then, stooping over the lifeless body,
she raised it in her arms, and, in the midst
of a yet more perfect stillness, as in the
presence of a being of a holier and a loftier
world, the Princess Isoline disappeared
with her burden into the forest depths.</p>

<p>She followed the path under the narrow
avenue, where she had once walked with
Mark, till she reached her quiet and melancholy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
house; and, entering at once into the
hall, she deposited her burden upon the
long table, where the household was wont
to dine. She laid it with the feet at one
end of the board, and, straightening the
stiffening limbs, she knelt down before it
and buried her face in her hands.</p>

<p>"<i>The good are not happy, and the happy
are not good</i>"&mdash;was she then good because
she was so miserable? Ah no! Or was
this wretchedness a wicked thing? Again,
surely not!</p>

<p>As she lay thus, crushed and beaten
down, her form contorted with sobs, a quiet
footstep roused her, and, raising her eyes,
she saw the Prince through her blinding
tears. He was standing by the table, near
the head of the child. His face was very
pale, and the eyes had lost the habitual<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
languor of their expression, and were full
of an earnest tender grief. The Princess
rose, and they looked each other straight
in the eyes. Through the mist of tears
the Prince's form became refined and purified,
and he stood there with a beauty
hitherto altogether unknown, even to her.</p>

<p>"I told this child, Isoline," he said; "I
told this child that I had done well to send
for him."</p>

<p>"Ferdinand," she said again, "it is not
you who have done this; it is I." She
stopped for a moment to recover control,
and went on more passionately&mdash;"I, who
pretended to the devoted life! in which
alone he could breathe; I, to whom he
looked for help and strength; I, who
deserted him and gave a false report of
the promised land."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>The Prince looked at her with eyes full
of compassion, but did not reply.</p>

<p>"You did what you could," continued
his sister; "your effort was surely a noble
one. More, in fact; you came to the help
of his faith against evil. It is always so!
The children of the world act always
better than the children of light!"</p>

<p>In her self-abasement and despair the
Princess did not remember Mark's words,
that the greatest trial of his faith had been
the Prince: a tolerance which is kindly
and even appreciative, and yet, as with a
clearness of a farther insight stands indifferently
aside, must always be the great
trial of simple faith.</p>

<p>"It is easier, Isoline," said her brother
at last, "to maintain a low standard than
a high. It seems to me that we have both<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
been wrong, but yours is the nobler fault.
You attempted an impossible flight&mdash;a
flight which human nature has no wings
strong enough to achieve. As for me,
this has been a terrible shock&mdash;more than
I could have thought possible, I who
fancied myself so secure and so serene.
That such a terrible chance could happen
shows how unstable are the most finished
schemes of life. I fancied that my life
was an art, and I dreamed that it might
be perfected&mdash;as a religious art. Fool
that I was! How can life or religion be
an art when the merest accident can dissolve
the entire fabric at a blow? No art
can exist in the presence of an impalpable
mystery, of an unknown, inappeasable, implacable
Force."</p>

<p>"No," said the Princess; "art is not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
enough!&mdash;morality, virtue, love even, is
not enough. None of these can pierce
the veil. Nothing profits, save the Divine
Humanity, which, through the mystery of
Sacrifice, has entered the unseen. You
know, Ferdinand," and she looked up
through her tears with a sad smile, "in
your art there was always in old times a
mystery."</p>

<p>She rose as she said this, and stood
more lovely than ever in her grief and in
her faith; and the Prince moved a step forward,
and put his hand upon the breast of
the child. As they stood, looking each other
full in the eyes, in the notorious beauty of
their order and of their race, it might have
seemed to a sanguine fancy that, over the
piteous victim of earth's failure, art and
religion for the moment were at one.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<h2>II.</h2>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">The</span> pleasure Palace was deserted. Mark
was buried in a shadowy graveyard behind
the old manor-house, where was a ruined
chapel that had been a canonry. The
Princess Isoline gave up her house, and
dissolved her family. They were scattered
to their several homes. She said that her
place was by her brother's side. It would
seem that none were sorry for some excuse.
The Prince could no longer endure the
place; he said that he had neglected his
princely cities, and must visit them for a
time. The Signorina was inconsolable, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
her singing improved day by day. The
Maestro began to have hopes of her. He
wrote to Vienna concerning an engagement
for her at the Imperial Theatre there, without
even consulting the Prince, who for the
moment was disgusted with the very name
of art. Old Carricchio said that the northern
sunshine was more intolerable than
ever, and that he should return to Italy, but
would take Vienna in his way. It might
be supposed that this old man would have
been much distressed, but, if this were the
case, he concealed his feelings with his
usual humorous eccentricity. He spent
most of his time listening to Tina's singing.
Even the Maestro and the pages seemed
to miss Mark more.</div>

<p>In the general disorganisation and confusion
the Princess even was not entirely<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
unaffected. She was continually speaking
of Mark, whose singular personality had
struck her fancy, and whose sudden and
pathetic death had touched her with pity.
She appeared unusually affectionate to her
husband and to his sister, and she despatched
the Count to secure a residence
in Vienna, where she expressed her intention
of taking the entire family as soon as
the Prince had satisfied his newly-awakened
conscience by a sight of Wertheim. The
children were delighted with the thought,
and were apparently consoled for the absence
of their tutor. Perhaps already his
tales had begun to tire.</p>

<p>The Maestro and Carricchio were walking
side by side upon the terrace where
Mark was used to sit.</p>

<p>"I shall make a sensation at Vienna,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
said the Maestro; "that little girl is growing
into an impassioned actress with a
marvellous voice. I have an idea. I have
already arranged the score. I shall throw
this story into the form of opera&mdash;a
serious opera, not one of your farcical
things. It is a charming story, most
pathetic, and will make people cry. That
boy's character was exquisite: 'Ah,' they
will say, 'that lovely child!'"</p>

<p>"I don't understand your pathos," said
Carricchio crossly,&mdash;"the pathos of composers
and writers and imaginative men. It
is all ideal. You talk of farce, I prefer the
jester's farce. I never knew any of you to
weep over any real misery&mdash;any starving
people, any loathsome, sordid poor!"</p>

<p>"I should think not," said the Maestro;
"there is nothing delightful in real misery<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>&mdash;it
is loathsome, as you say; it is horrible,
it is disagreeable even! Art never contemplates
the disagreeable; it would cease
to be true art if it did. But when you are
happy yourself, when you are surrounded
by comfort and luxury&mdash;<i>then</i> to contemplate
misery, sorrow, woe! Ah! this is the
height of luxury: this is art! Yes, true
art!"</p>

<p>"It seems selfish, to me," said the
Arlecchino surlily.</p>

<p>"Selfish!" exclaimed the Maestro; "of
course it is selfish! Unless it is selfish it
cannot be art. Art has an end, an aim, an
intention&mdash;if it deserts this aim it ceases to
be art. It must be selfish."</p>

<p>There was a slight pause, then the
Maestro, who seemed to be in great spirits,
went on:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>"I always thought the Prince a poor
creature, now I am sure of it. He is
neither one thing nor the other. He will
never be an artist, in the true sense."</p>

<p>"He is very sorry for that poor child,"
said Carricchio.</p>

<p>"Sorry!" exclaimed the Maestro. "Sorry!
I tell you when the canary died I was delighted,
but I am still more delighted now.
I predict to you a great future for the
Signorina. She will be a great actress
and singer. The death of this child is
everything to us; it was just what was
required to give her power, to stir the
depths of her nature. <i>Mio caro</i>," he continued
caressingly, putting his hand on
Carricchio's arm, "believe me, <i>this</i> is life,
and <i>this</i> is art!"</p>

<p>"He is a cold-blooded old devil," muttered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
Carricchio savagely, as he turned
away, "with his infernal talk of art. I
would not go to Vienna with him but for
the Signorina. I will see her once upon
the stage there. Then the old worn-out
Arlecchino will go back into the sunshine,
and die, and go to Mark."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>III.</h2>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">The</span> Maestro's romantic opera was a success.
He was at least so far a genius that
he knew where he was strong and where
he was weak.</div>

<p>He reproduced with great exactness the
play in the palace gardens, but he kept the
person and character of Mark enshrouded
in mystery, allowing him to appear very
seldom, and trusting entirely to the singing
of the principal performers, and especially
of the Signorina, to impress the
audience with the idea of his purity and
innocence. He surpassed himself in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
intense wistful music of the score; never
had he produced such pathetic airs, such
pleading sustained harmonies, such quivering
lingering chords and cadences. At
the supreme moment the boy appears, and,
after singing with exquisite melody his
hapless yet heroic fate, offers his bosom to
the sacrificial knife. But a god intervenes.
Veiled in cloud and recognised in thunders,
a divine and merciful hand is laid upon
the child. Death comes to him as a sleep,
and over his dead and lovely form the
anger of heaven is appeased. Incapable
as the Maestro was of feeling much of the
pathos and beauty of his own work, still,
with that wonderful instinct, or art, or
genius, which supplies the place of feeling,
he produced, amid much that was grotesque
and incongruous, a work of delicate<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
touch and thrilling and entrancing sound.
The little theatre near the Kohl market,
where the piece was first produced, was
crowded nightly, and the narrow thoroughfares
through private houses and courtyards,
called Durch-h&auml;user, with which
the extraordinary and otherwise impenetrable
maze of building which formed old
Vienna was pierced through and through,
were filled with fine and delicate ladies
and gay courtiers seeking admission. So
great, indeed, was the success that an
arrangement was made with the conductors
of the Imperial Theatre for the opera to
be performed there. The Empress-Queen
and her husband were present, the frigid
silence of etiquette was broken more than
once by applause, and the Abate Metastasio
wrote some lines for the Signorina;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
indeed, the success of the piece was caused
by the girl's singing.</p>

<p>"Mark is better than the canary," the
Maestro was continually repeating.</p>

<p>In his hour of triumph the old gentleman
presented a quaint and attractive
study to the observer of the by-ways of
art. Amid the rococo surroundings among
which he moved, he was himself a singular
example of the power of art to extract
from bizarre and unpromising material
somewhat at least of pure and lasting fruit.
He had attired his withered and lean
figure in brilliant hues and the finest lace,
and in this attire he trained the girl, also
fantastically dressed, to warble the most
touching and delicious plaints. The instinctive
pathos of inanimate things, of
forms and colours, was perceived in sound,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
and much that hitherto seemed paltry and
frivolous was refined and ennobled. Mark's
death, and even that of the poor canary,
was beginning to bear fruit. Nature and
love were feeling out the enigma of existence
by the aid of art.</p>

<p>The reference to the canary was not,
indeed, made in the presence of Tina, for
the Maestro found that it was not acceptable.
Nevertheless, a strange fellowship
and affection was springing up between
these two. The critics complained that
the Signorina varied her notes; but, in fact,
the score of the opera never remained the
same&mdash;at least as regarded her parts. As
she sang, with the Maestro beside her at
the harpsichord, imagination and recollection,
instructed by the magic of sound,
touched her notes with an unconscious<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
pathos and revealed to her master, with
his ready pencil in one hand and the other
on the keys, fresh heights and depths of
cultured harmony, new combinations of
fluttering, melodious notes.</p>

<p>This copartnership, this action and
reaction, had something wonderful and
charming about it; the power of nature
in the girl's voice suggesting possibilities
of more melodious, more artistic pathos to
the composer, the girl's passionate instinct
recognising the touch, and confessing the
help, of the master's skill. It seems a
strange duet, yet I do not know that we
should think it strange.</p>

<p>The girl's nature, pure and loving, was
supremely moved by the discovery of this
power of realisation and expression which it
had obtained; but at times it frightened her.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p>"I hate all this," she would cry sometimes,
starting away from the harpsichord;
"they are dead and cold, and I sing!"</p>

<p>"Sing! <i>mia cara!</i>" the old man would
say, with, for him, a soft and kindly tone;
"you cannot help but sing: and when did
love and sorrow feel so near and real to
you as when, just now, you sang that
phrase in F minor?"</p>

<p>"It is wicked!" said the girl; but she
sang over again, to the perfect satisfaction
of her master, the phrase in F minor.</p>

<p>"It is true," she said, after a pause.
"I knew not how to love&mdash;I knew not
what love was till I learned to sing from
you. Every day I learn more what love
is; I feel every hour more able to love&mdash;I
love you more and more for teaching
me the art of love."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ah, <i>mia cara</i>," said the Maestro, "that
was not difficult! You were born with
that gift. But it is strange to me, I
confess it, how pathetically you sing. It
is not in the music&mdash;at any rate, not in my
music. It is beyond my art and even
strange to it, but it touches even me."</p>

<p>And the old man shrugged his shoulders
with an odd gesture, in which something
like self-contempt struggled with an unaccustomed
emotion.</p>

<p>The girl had turned half round, and
was looking at him with her bright, yet
wistful eyes.</p>

<p>"Never mind, Maestro," she said; "I
shall love you always for your music, in
spite of your contempt of love, and your
miserable, cold&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>And she gave a little shudder. She<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
was forming, indeed, a passionate regard
for the old man, solely for the sake of his
art.</p>

<p>It was not by any means the first time
that such an event had occurred, for unselfish
love is much more common than
cynical mankind believes.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>IV.</h2>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">The</span> Prince soon grew tired of Wertheim.
Apart from other reasons, of which perhaps
we may learn something hereafter, he
felt lost without the accustomed <i>entourage</i>
which he had attracted to Joyeuse. The
death of Mark had made a profound impression
upon his delicately strung temperament.
It disturbed the lofty serenity of his life,
it shocked his taste, it was bad art. That
such a thing could have happened to him
in the very citadel and arcanum of his
carefully designed existence&mdash;and should
have happened, too, as the result of his own<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
individual purpose and action&mdash;arrested
him as with an archangel's sword; showed
him forcibly that his delicately woven
mail was deficient in some important, but
as yet unperceived, point; that his fancifully
conceived prince-life was liable to
sudden catastrophe. He had lived delicately,
but the bitterness of death was not
passed. He left Wertheim, and, travelling
with his children and servants in several
carriages and <i>chaises de poste</i>, he journeyed
to Vienna, whither the Princess had preceded
him.</div>

<p>The Prince travelled alone in a <i>carrosse-coup&eacute;</i>,
or travelling chaise, at the head of
his party. The Barotin and the children
followed him in the second carriage, which
was full of toys for their entertainment;
now and again one or the other would be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
promoted for a stage or two to their father's
carriage, to remain there as long as they
entertained him. After a time they entered
upon the flat plains of the Danube
and approached Vienna.</p>

<p>As they crossed the flat waste of water
meadows, over the long bridges of boats,
and through the rows of poplars, a drive
usually so dreary to travellers to Vienna,
the sun broke out gloriously and the afternoon
became very fine. For many miles
before him, over the monotonous waste,
the great tower of St. Stephen's Church
had confronted the Prince, crowned with
its gigantic eagle and surrounded by
wheeling flocks of birds&mdash;cranes and
ravens and daws. Herons and storks
rose now and again from the ditches and
pools by the wayside and flitted across<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
the road. The brilliant light shone upon
the mists of the river and upon the distant
crags and woods.</p>

<p>The Prince was alone; the children
were tired and restless from the long
journey, and were sent back to the long-suffering
Barotin. He lay back upon the
rich furs which filled the carriage, and
kept his eyes listlessly fixed upon the
distant tower. The descending sun lighted
up the weather-stains and the vari-coloured
mosses that covered its sides; a rainbow,
thrown across the black clouds of the
north and east, spanned the heavens with
a lofty arch.</p>

<p>The Prince gazed wearily over the
striking scene. Existence appeared to
him, at the moment, extremely complicated.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p>"It was a terrible mistake," he said, his
thoughts still running on the old disaster;
"a terrible mistake! Yet they cannot be
right&mdash;Isoline and the people with her&mdash;who
talk of nothing but sacrifice and self-denial,
and denounce everything by which
life is not only made endurable, but by
which, indeed, it is actually maintained in
being. What would life be if every one
were as they? 'Ah!' she says, 'there is
little chance of that! So few think of
aught save self! So few deny themselves
for the sake of others, you need not grudge
us few our self-chosen path.' That is
where they make the fatal mistake. Each
man should carve out his life, as a whole,
as though the lives of all were perfect, not
as if it were a broken fragment of a fine
statue; each should be a perfect Apollo of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
the Belvedere Gardens, not a mere torso;
not a strong arm only that can strike, not
a finger only that can beckon&mdash;even though
it be to God. Because all cannot enjoy
them, does that make assorted colour, and
sweet sound, and delicate pottery less
perfect, less worthy to be sought? He
should aim at the complete life&mdash;should
love, and feel, and enjoy."</p>

<p>The great tower rose higher and higher
above the Prince as he thought these last
words aloud; the screaming kites and
daws wheeled above his head; the great
eagle loomed larger and larger in the
evening light. They passed over the
wide glacis, threaded the drawbridges and
barriers, and entered the tortuous narrow
streets. A golden haze lighted the
crowded thoroughfares and beautified the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
carving and gables of the lofty houses.
A motley crowd of people, from east and
west alike, in strange variety of costume,
thronged the causeways, and hardly
escaped the carriage-wheels in their reckless
course. The sight roused the Prince
from his melancholy, and he gazed with an
amused and even delighted air from his
carriage-windows. His nature, pleasure-loving
and imaginative, found this moving
life a source of never-tiring interest and
suggestiveness. The fate, the interests,
the aims, and sorrows of every human
figure that passed across his vision, even
for a second, formed itself in some infinitely
slight, yet perfectly real and tangible,
degree in his mind; and he conceived
the stir and tremor of a great city's life
with a perfect grasp of all the little details<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
that make up the dramatic, the graphic
whole.</p>

<p>The carriage swept through the Place
St. Michael, past the Imperial Palace, and,
pursuing its course through the winding
streets to the imminent peril of the populace
of Croats, Servians, Germans, and a mixed
people of no nation under heaven, reached
the <i>H&ocirc;tel</i> which had been selected for the
Prince in the Tein quarter.</p>

<p>Though this quiet quarter is in close
neighbourhood to the most busy and noisy
parts of the city, the contrast was striking.
The Prince saw nothing here but quaint
palaces crowded together within a space
of a few hundred yards. Here were the
palaces of the Lichtensteins, the Festetics,
the Esterhazys, the Sch&ouml;nbornes. Antique
escutcheons were hanging before the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
houses, and strange devices of the golden
fleece, and other crests and bearings were
erected on the gables and roofs. Vienna
was emphatically the city of heraldry, and
a tendency towards Oriental taste in noble
and burgher produced a fantastic architecture
of gables and minarets, breaking the
massive lines of fortress-like medi&aelig;val
palace and <i>h&ocirc;tel</i>. Here and there a
carriage was standing in the quiet street,
and servants in gaudy liveries stood in the
sunshine about the steps and gates.</p>

<p>The next morning the Prince was seated
at his toilette, in the hands of his dresser,
who was frizzling and powdering his hair.
By his side was standing his valet or body-servant,
as he would be called in England&mdash;<i>Chasseur</i>
or <i>Jager</i>, as he was called in
North or South Germany. This man was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
one of the most competent of his order,
and devoted to his master.</p>

<p>"Well, Karl," the Prince was saying,
with his kindly air, "thou breathest again
here, I doubt not. This place is more to
thy mind than Joyeuse&mdash;<i>n'est ce pas?</i>
There is life here and intrigue. It is
better even than Rome? Is it so?"</p>

<p>"Wherever the Serene Highness is," replied
Karl graciously, "I am content and
happy. I was happy in Rome, in Joyeuse,
at Wertheim; but I confess that I like
Wien. There is colour here, and quaintness,
and <i>esprit</i>."</p>

<p>Karl had picked up many art terms with
the rest of the princely household.</p>

<p>"Ah! Wertheim!" said the Prince,
rather sadly as it seemed. "I like
Wertheim, ah! so much&mdash;for a day or two.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
One is so great a man there. I know
every one, and every one knows me. I
feel almost like a beneficent Providence,
and as though I had discovered the
perfection of art in life. When I walk in
the garden avenue after dinner, between
the statues, and every one has right of
audience and petition, and one old woman
begs that her only son may be excused
from military service, and another that her
stall in the market may not be taken away;
and one old man's house is burnt down,
and he wants help to rebuild it, and
another craves right of wood-gathering in
the princely forests, and another begs that
his son may be enrolled among the under-keepers
and beaters of the game, with
right of snaring a hare,&mdash;and all these
things are so easy to grant, and seem to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
these poor folks so gracious, and like the
gifts of heaven, that one thinks for the
moment that this must be the perfection
of life. But it palls, Karl; in a day or two
it palls! The wants and sufferings of the
poor are so much alike; they want variety,
they are so deficient in shade, they are
such poor art!" and the Prince sighed
wearily.</p>

<p>"That is natural for the Serene Highness,"
said Karl, with a sympathising pity
which was amusing; "that is natural to
the Serene Highness, who does not see
below the surface, and to whom all speak
with bated breath. There is plenty of
light and shade in the lives of the poor,
if you go deep enough."</p>

<p>"Ah!" said the Prince with interest, "is
it so? Doubtless now, within a few yards<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
of us, there are art-scenes enacted, tragedies
and comedies going on, of which you know
the different <i>r&ocirc;les</i>&mdash;one of which, maybe,
you fill yourself. Eh, Karl?"</p>

<p>"It is a great city, Highness," said Karl.
"They are all alike, good and ill, love and
hatred, the knave and the fool. All the
world over, it is much the same."</p>

<p>At this moment, the hair-powdering
being over, the Prince rose.</p>

<p>"Well," he said, "to-night the Signorina
sings at the Imperial Theatre. She and
the Maestro sup with me afterwards. The
Princess sups at the Palace."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<h2>V.</h2>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">It</span> is difficult at the present day to realise
such scenes as that presented by the Imperial
Theatre during the performance that
evening. The comparative smallness of
the interior and dimness of the lights,
combined with the incomparable splendour
and richness in the appearance of the
audience which filled every portion of the
theatre, even to the gallery of the servants,
with undiminished brilliancy, produced an
effect of subdued splendour and of a mystic
glow of colour which we should look
for in vain in any theatre in Europe now.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></div>

<p>The Empress-Queen and her husband
occupied a central box, and the Court,
graduated according to rank, and radiating
from this centre, filled boxes, pit, and
gallery. The Prince's box was on the
royal tier, not far from the Empress. He
was accompanied by the Princess and
his sister.</p>

<p>"I am delighted with Isoline," the
Princess said; "that poor child's death
has worked wonders upon her in a way no
one would have expected. She seems to
have thrown off her singular fancies, and
behaves as other people do."</p>

<p>"Isoline never was very easy to understand,"
said the Prince.</p>

<p>Whether or not she were inspired by
the presence of the Prince, the Signorina
had never sung so wonderfully as she did<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
that night. The frigid silence of Imperial
etiquette, so discouraging and chilling to
southern artists, gave place, now and
again, to an irrepressible murmur of emotion
and applause. The passionate yearning
of the purest love, the pathos of
unselfish grief, found a fit utterance in
notes of an inimitable sweetness, and in
melodies whose dainty phrases were ennobled
and mellowed at once by delicate
art and loftiest feeling. The house gave
way at last to an uncontrollable enthusiasm,
and, regardless of Court etiquette, the entire
assembly rose to its feet amid a tumult
of applause.</p>

<p>Not far from the Maestro, who was
conducting the music from the centre of
the orchestra, was seated Carricchio. He
had, of course, discarded his professional<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
dress, and had attired himself, according
to the genius of his countrymen, in rich
but dark and plain attire. Any one who
could have watched his face&mdash;that face
which the little Schoolmaster was used to
wonder at&mdash;and could have marked the
quaint mingling, on the large worn features,
of the old humorous movement with
the new emotions of wonder and of love,
would not have spent his moments in
vain.</p>

<p>But the success was too complete. The
Empress-Queen was shocked at the breach
of decorum. She was not in the least
touched by the Signorina's singing, and the
story of the opera was unintelligible to
her. It was suggested by those who were
offended and injured by the success of the
piece, and by the displacement of other<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
operas, that this arrangement entailed increased
expense upon the royal treasury,
and, amid the penurious and pettifogging
instincts of the Court of Vienna in those
days, this was a fatal thrust. The theatre,
it was said, was required for other pieces,
notably for a new opera by Metastasio
himself.</p>

<p>"It was very beautiful, Ferdinand,"
said the Princess, as they left the box;
and, struck by her tone and by the unaccustomed
use of his name, the Prince
looked at her with surprise, for it was
years since he had seen the sweet, softened,
well-remembered look in her eyes. "I
liked that boy!"</p>

<p>"I will convey your approbation to the
Signorina," replied the Prince; "it will
complete the triumph of the night."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>"Where do you sup to-night, Ferdinand?"
said the Princess.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I sup in private with the Maestro
and Tina," said the Prince.</p>

<p>"Ah!" said the Princess, still with the
same wistful, unaccustomed look. "There
is a cover laid for me at the Imperial table&mdash;I
must go."</p>

<p>It is absurd to talk of what would have
happened had the threads of our lives been
woven into different tissues, else we might
say that but for that Imperial cover the
issues of this story would have had a
different close.</p>

<p>The Maestro waited at the theatre till
the Signorina had changed her dress.
When she appeared she was radiant with
triumph and delight, but the old man was
sad and depressed. Some intimation of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
the fatal resolution had been conveyed to
him in the interval.</p>

<p>"What is the matter with you, Maestro?"
said the girl; "you ought to be delighted,
and you look as gloomy as a ghost. What
is it?"</p>

<p>"It is nothing," said the Maestro. "I
am an old man, <i>mia cara</i>, and the performance
tires me. Let us go to the Prince."</p>

<p>They entered a fiacre, and were driven
to the courtyard of the Prince's <i>H&ocirc;tel</i>.</p>

<p>The supper, though private, was luxurious,
and was attended by all the servants
of the Prince. Inspired by the success of
the night, the Prince exerted himself to
please; but, apart from all other circumstances,
the Signorina would have delighted
any man. She was at that delightful age
when the girl is passing into the woman;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
she was increasing daily in beauty, she
was perfectly dressed, she was radiant that
night with happiness, and with the consciousness
of success; she was touched by
the recollection of the past, and profoundly
affected by the power of expression which
she had found in song; more than this&mdash;much
more&mdash;she was drawn irresistibly by
a feeling of pity and sympathy towards
the old man; she could not understand his
depression and gloom; she paid little
attention to the Prince, but lavished a
thousand pretty arts and delicate attentions
on the vain endeavour to rouse her friend.
No other conduct could have rendered her
so attractive in the eyes of the Prince.
To his refined and really high-toned taste,
this pretty devotedness, this manifestly
pure affection and gratitude, as of a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
daughter, commended by such loveliness
and vivacity, were irresistible. It was
exactly that combination of pathos and
grace and art that suited his cultured fancy
and the long habit of his trained life. He
was inexpressibly delighted and happy.
Forgetful of past mistake and misfortune,
he congratulated himself on his success in
attaching to his person and family so lively
and dulcet a creature. His scheme of life
seemed complete and authorised to his
conscience by success.</p>

<p>Once more he uttered the fatal words,
"<i>I will have</i> this girl."</p>

<p>"You are the happiest man I know,
Maestro," he said; "you are truly a
creative artist, for you not only create
melodious sounds and spirit-stirring ideas,
but you actually create flesh and blood<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
sirens and human creatures as lovely as
your sounds, and far more real. The
Signorina is your work, and see, as is
natural, how devoted she is to her maker."</p>

<p>"Every one thinks others happier than
himself, Prince," said the old man, still
gloomy. "As for the Signorina, she has
much more made me than I her. I shall
only injure and cripple her."</p>

<p>The girl looked at him with tears in
her eyes.</p>

<p>"The Maestro is not well," she said to
the Prince; "he will be more cheerful
to-morrow. Success frightens him. It is
often more terrible than failure."</p>

<p>"He fears that you will forsake him,
when you are courted and praised so
much," said the Prince in a low voice, for
the old man seemed scarcely to notice<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
what passed; "he fears you will forsake
him," and as he spoke the Prince kept his
eyes fixed inquiringly on the girl's face.</p>

<p>The Signorina said nothing. She turned
her dark great eyes full on the old man,
and the Prince wanted no more than what
the eyes told him.</p>

<p>"She is a glorious creature," he said to
himself.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>VI.</h2>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">The</span> next morning the crash came. The
Maestro was informed that only one more
performance could be allowed at the Imperial
Theatre, and that, further, there
were difficulties in the way of the performance
being permitted in any theatre in
Vienna. The old man was crushed: he
came to the Signorina with the notice in
his hand.</div>

<p>"<i>Mia cara</i>," he said, making great efforts
to be calm, "this is the end. I am a
broken and a ruined man. I have been
all my life waiting for this chance&mdash;this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
gift of inspiration. I thought that it would
never come; it tarried so long, and I grew
so old. At last it came, but only just in
time. I have never written anything like
this music, and never shall again. Now it
is stopped. I must go. I cannot stay
where it must not be played; I must go
somewhere, and take my music with me.
It will not be for long. The Prince will
not leave Vienna. He is pleased with the
city and with his reception. I must leave
you all."</p>

<p>The girl was on her feet before him,
with flashing eyes which were full of tears.</p>

<p>"Maestro!" she said; "what mean you
to talk in this way? Do you suppose that
I will ever leave you, that I will stay if
you go? I owe everything to you. I
cannot sing without you. I will follow<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
you to Paris&mdash;anywhere. Whatever fortune
awaits you shall await us both."</p>

<p>"Ah, Tina," said the old man, "you
are very good, but you mistake. I am not
the great master you suppose. I know
it too well. There is always something
wanting in my notes. When you sing
them, well and good. Even as they are
they never would have been scored but
for you. When I leave you the glamour
will be taken out of them. They will be
cold and dead: no one will think anything
of them any more."</p>

<p>"If this be true," said the girl, almost
fiercely, "it is all the more reason why I
will never leave you! You have made
me, as the Prince said; I am yours for
life. Wherever you go I will go; whatever
you write I will sing. If we fail, we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
fail together. If we succeed, the success
is yours."</p>

<p>She paused for a moment, and then,
with a deeper flush and a tender confidence
which seemed inspired:</p>

<p>"And we shall succeed! I have not
yet sung my best. I, too, know it. You
have not yet made me all you may. Whatever
you teach me I will sing!"</p>

<p>The old man looked at her, as well he
might, deeply moved, but he shook his
head.</p>

<p>"Tina," he said, "I will not have it.
You must not be ruined for me. You
must not go. Other masters, greater than
I, will finish what it is my happiness to
have begun. The world will ring with
your name. Art will be enriched with
your glorious singing. I shall hear of it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
before I die. The old Maestro will say,
'Ah, that is the girl whom I taught.'"</p>

<p>The girl was standing now quite calm,
all trace of emotion even had past away.
She looked at him with a serene smile
that was sublime in its rest. It was not
worth while even to say a word.</p>

<div class='center'><b>*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *</b></div>

<p>The decision of the Maestro and the
Signorina filled the princely household
with distress. Tina had been, at Joyeuse,
the light and joy of a joyful place; and,
although the household saw much less of
her at Vienna, yet the charm of her presence
and of her triumphs was still their
own. The Prince heard the news with
absolute dismay. It was not only that he
had begun to love the girl, he conceived
that she belonged to him of right. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
Maestro was his; he had assisted, maintained,
and patronised him; by his encouragement
and in his service he had
discovered the girl and trained her in
music. They were both part of his
scheme, of his art of life. It was bad,
doubtless, that, when he had attempted
still higher flights, when he had wished to
bring, and, as he had once thought, succeeded
in bringing, religion, faith, and
piety, with all their delicate loveliness, to
grace the abundance of his life's feast&mdash;it
was bad, doubtless, that, at the moment
of success, a terrible catastrophe should
have cruelly broken this lovely plaything,
and left him with a haunting conscience as
of well-nigh a deliberate murderer. All
this was bad, but now he seemed about to
fail, not only in these original and high<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
efforts, which perhaps had never been
attempted before, but in the simplest
schemes of art; and to fail, to be foiled by
the perversity of a girl! He had great
influence in Vienna; he doubted not but
that he could soon overcome the opposition
of interested rivals, or, if not exactly this,
there were other masters besides this one,
there was other music for the Signorina
to sing. He believed with him that her
future would be brilliant, and he considered
himself the rightful possessor of her triumph
and of her charm. He imperiously ordered
the Maestro to remain.</p>

<p>The old man begged to be excused.</p>

<p>He was old and broken down, he said;
he had taught the Signorina all he knew.
Henceforward he must pass her on to
abler teachers. It was no wish of his that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
she should accompany him, he had urged
her to remain.</p>

<p>In truth, as was not wonderful, his
whole heart was in this last music of his;
as a matter of selfish pride and enjoyment
even, apart from his narrow, though to
some extent real, conceptions of art, he
must hear it again performed in a great
theatre, and that soon.</p>

<p>The vexation of the Prince became
excessive. He lost his habitual ease
and serenity of tone. He sent for Carricchio.</p>

<p>The Princess Isoline was with him.</p>

<p>"Let the girl go, Ferdinand," she was
saying. "Let her go for a time. She
will improve by travel, and by singing in
other cities. She is of a grateful and
affectionate nature; be sure that she will<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
never forget you: she will return when
you send for her."</p>

<p>Then, as Carricchio was announced, the
Princess rose and left the room.</p>

<p>"Carricchio," said the Prince impetuously,
"you must stop this nonsense of
the Banti's leaving Vienna. If the Maestro
chooses to stay, well and good. If he
chooses to go, also good. He will be a
stupid old fool! But it is his own business.
I have nothing to do with it; but Tina
shall not go. She belongs to me. I will
not have it. You have influence with her,
and must stop it."</p>

<p>"Highness," said Carricchio, "she will
not go for long. The Maestro is old and
broken; he will be helpless among
strangers, hostile or indifferent. She will
be friendless; she will be glad to come<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
back;" and there passed over Carricchio's
face an unconscious habitual grimace.</p>

<p>"I tell you," said the Prince, "she shall
not go at all. She belongs to me: voice
and body and soul, she belongs to me."</p>

<p>He was flushed with excitement. In
spite of the habitual dignity of manner and
of gesture which he could not wholly lose,
his appearance, as he stood in the centre of
the room before Carricchio, was so strange,
so different from its usual lofty quiet, that
the latter looked at him with surprise, and
even apprehension.</p>

<p>"<i>Mon Prince</i>," he said at last, "beware!
Take the warning of an old man. Let her
alone. God warns every man once&mdash;sometimes
twice&mdash;seldom a third time. My
Prince, let her alone!"</p>

<p>"What, Carricchio!" said the Prince<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
lightly. "Are you also one of us? Are
we all in love with a little singing-girl?"</p>

<p>"My Prince," said Carricchio, "it matters
little what an old fool like me loves or
does not love. I am a broken old Arlecchino,
you a Prince. She will have none
of us. She alone of all of us&mdash;Prince and
Princess and clown alike&mdash;has solved the
riddle which that boy, whom we killed,
was sent to teach us. She alone has
made her life an art, for she alone has
found that art is capable of sacrifice. She
alone of all of us has based her art upon
nature and upon love. She is passionately
devoted to her master&mdash;her father in art
and life, for he rescued her from poverty
and shame. She will follow him through
the world. <i>Mon Prince</i>, let her alone."</p>

<p>"To let her go," said the Prince, "would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
be to spoil everything. Shall I give up a
deliberate plan of life, finely conceived and
carefully carried out, to gratify the whims
of a foolish girl? Why is religion to interfere
always with art? Why is sacrifice
always to be preached to us? Life is not
sacrifice: it is a morbid, monkish idea.
Life is success, fruition, enjoyment. Life
is an art&mdash;religion also should be an art."</p>

<p>"Where there is love," said Carricchio,
"there must be sacrifice, and no life is
perfect without love. There are only two
things capable of sacrifice&mdash;nature and
love. When art is saturated with nature
and elevated by love, it becomes a religion,
but religion never becomes an art; for
art without nature and without love is
partial and selfish, and cannot include the
whole of life. You will find, believe me,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
that if you follow art apart from these two,
you have indeed only been following a
deception, for it has not only been irreligion,
it has been bad art."</p>

<p>"The sphere of religion," said the
Prince, "is the present, and its scope the
whole of human life. It is, therefore, an
art. If art is selfish, so is religion. The
most disinterested martyr is selfish, for he
is following the dictates of his higher self.
I tell you Tina is mine, I want her. She
shall not go!"</p>

<p>"You said the same of the boy, Highness,"
said Carricchio gravely; "yet he
went&mdash;went a long journey from us all.
<i>Mon Prince</i>, beware!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>VII.</h2>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">Failing</span> with the old Arlecchino, the Prince
determined to try his own influence with
the girl; but he had no intention of acting
in a blundering and inartistic manner. He
was too good an artist not to prepare the
way. Having failed with Carricchio, he
resolved to try the Maestro once more.</div>

<p>He sent for the old man. "Maestro,"
he said, "I regret exceedingly what has
happened. I do not wish to make a disturbance
immediately after coming to Court
after so long an absence. It would not be
well. But we shall soon put things right.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
Meanwhile, if you like to travel for a few
months you can do so. There is no necessity
for it that I know of, but it will be an
entertainment for you, and you will gather
ideas for your music, and, no doubt, fame
also. If the Signorina remains here, you
shall have letters of credit on Paris or
any other city. As you will not be dependent
on your music, it probably will
be a great success. As the Scripture
says, 'To him that hath shall be given.'
When you are tired of wandering you
can return. But Tina remains here&mdash;you
understand."</p>

<p>"I have already tried to persuade her,
Highness," said the old man.</p>

<p>"Well, you must try again. You shall
sup with her to-night, as you are neither
of you wanted at the opera. I will order<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
supper for you in <i>la petite Salle</i> beyond
the <i>salon</i>. When I return at night I shall
find everything arranged."</p>

<p>The Prince himself went to the opera.
He did not care to be seen, as he was supposed
to have received a slight, but he
had nothing else to do, and was interested
in the performance, which was a new opera
by Metastasio. Indeed, he was restless,
and wanted diversion of any kind.</p>

<p>He sat well back in his box, across the
front of which the delicate lace curtains
were partly drawn. Karl the <i>Jager</i>, and
the valet who attended, had left the box
and retired to their own gallery, where
they criticised the play and the music with
more interest than did their master. The
Prince lay back in his chair, watching the
piece listlessly through the gauzy screen,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
and listening half heedlessly to the music&mdash;the
wonderful music of Pergolesi.</p>

<p>The fairy world of song and harmony,
peopled by fantastic and impossible creatures
who exist only for the sake of the
melodies which give them birth, was not
devoid of powerful and pathetic phases of
passion and of character; but what made
its lesson particularly adapted to the
Prince's frame of mind, and gradually
aroused his languid interest, was the subordination
of passion and character to the
nicest art. The deepest sorrow warbled
to exquisite airs; passion, despairing and
bewildered, flinging itself as an evil thing
across the devious paths of Romance, yet
never for a second forgetful of the nicest
harmony or capable of a jarring note.
This ideal musical world&mdash;bizarre and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
rococo as, in some respects, it was&mdash;seemed
to the Prince in some sort an allegory, or
even parody, on the art-life he had set himself
to create or to perfect. He thought
he saw that even its faults were instinct
with, and revealed, the secret of which he
was in search. Faultiness and feebleness,
folly and littleness, seemed restrained, corrected,
transformed, when presented in
solemn, noble, and pure melodies. Everything
in this parody of life was ruled by
art just as, in the so-called reality, he had
wished. The lesson was not altogether a
noble one. Passion, ennobled by art, lost
its fatal, repellent aspect, and became perfect
as an artistic whole. Here the poison
worked readily in the Prince's mind. To
sacrifice the least portion of this art-life to
any narrow illiterate scruples was to sin<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
against its perfection, without which the
whole structure were worthless. Better,
far better, throw the entire scheme to the
winds. Imperfect art is worse than none
at all. He had already forgotten, if he had
ever listened to it, Carricchio's warning
against unreal and loveless art.</p>

<p>Moreover, as the play went on, and the
fantastic adventures and fortunes of its
strange actors gradually won the Prince's
attention and attracted his interest, through
the gauzy veil of the curtains and the haze
of delicious melody, his desire was excited
and he longed to play out his own part on
a real stage, and with tangible, no longer
ideal, delights and success. Why did he
sit there gazing at a mere show of life,
when life itself, in a form strangely attractive
and prepared&mdash;life which he himself<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
had in some sort formed and created&mdash;awaited
him, with parts and scenes, ready
for the playing, compared to which all the
glamour of the piece before him was a mere
dream-shade? Fortune had been kind to
him; or rather, he thought, his patient
loyalty to art had wrought the usual result.
As he had followed his steadfast course,
nature, chance, the confusions and spite of
men, had all tended to co-operate with him,
had each supplied a thread of gold to perfect
his brilliant woof of coloured existence.
The moment seemed at hand; let him no
longer dally with shadows, but play his
own part, compared with which the piece
before him was poor and tame.</p>

<p>"<i>La petite Salle</i>," as the Prince had
called it&mdash;in which supper had been laid<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
for Tina and the Maestro&mdash;was situated at
the end of a splendid "<i>apartement</i>," which
contained the <i>salon</i> and the other reception-rooms
of the <i>H&ocirc;tel</i>. It communicated with
other rooms and private staircases, and was
therefore peculiarly suitable for purposes
of retirement. It was decorated, with the
picturesque daintiness of the French Court,
in panels painted in imitation of Watteau,
festooned with silk, embroidered with
flowers. One or two cabinets supporting
plate, and chairs richly embroidered in
vari-coloured silk, completed the furniture.
The supper was served on a small round
table, with a costly service of china and
Venetian glass.</p>

<p>Tina had accepted the invitation with
pleasure. She had feared that this evening,
when the work of another was being performed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
at the Imperial Theatre, to the
exclusion of his great masterpiece, would
have been a time of great depression with
the Maestro, and she resolved to endeavour
to cheer him. She had dressed herself
with the greatest care, and without thought
of cost. She had never looked so charming&mdash;every
day seemed to mature her
beauty. The supper was all that could
have been expected or wished; nevertheless
the Maestro was distrait and even
sulky. Tina lavished her bewitching wiles
and enchantments upon him in vain.</p>

<p>After the first course or two, which, it
must be admitted, were served by the attendants
in a somewhat perfunctory manner,
the Maestro dismissed the servants,
saying that the Signorina and he would
prefer waiting upon themselves: dumb<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
waiters, containing wines and other accessories,
were placed by the table's side, and
the servants left the room.</p>

<p>Still the Maestro seemed ill at ease.
Tina, finding that her sallies were received
with a morose indifference, relapsed into
silence, and sat furtively glancing at her
companion, with a pouting, disconsolate
air which, it might have been thought,
would have been found irresistible even
by an ascetic.</p>

<p>At last the Maestro, after several futile
attempts, and with an awkward and embarrassed
air, began:</p>

<p>"I have been thinking, Signora," he
said, "over my future plans, and I have
resolved not to try to get my music performed,
at present at any rate, in any great
city. I am old and want rest. I propose<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
to travel for a few months. It will therefore
not be necessary to take you from
Vienna."</p>

<p>His manner was so constrained, and his
resolution so unexpected, that the girl
looked at him with perplexity. It was, of
course, impossible for her, in her ignorance,
to perceive that what was troubling the
Maestro was the difficulty of concealing
from himself that he had accepted a bribe
to desert his art and his friend.</p>

<p>"Maestro," she said at last, "what can
you mean?&mdash;you to whom it has been
given to achieve such a success? How can
you talk of rest? What rest can be more
perfect than to listen to your own wonderful
music? To see, to feel, the power of
your glorious art over others, over yourself?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<p>The Maestro hesitated and floundered
worse than before. He was, as he had
said himself, when under the influence of
as noble feeling as he was capable of, a bad
artist; but he had sufficient of the true
instinct to be conscious of his bad work.
He was ashamed of himself and of his
<i>fain&eacute;antise</i>. He made a bungling business
of it all round.</p>

<p>He had, before the Prince had made
his offer, <a name="begun" id="begun"></a>begun to regret that in a moment
of irritation he had been so precipitate in
insisting upon leaving Vienna; but now
that an offer of freedom, of a sojourn in
Paris, of independent means, was made
him, the proposal was too attractive to be
declined. He felt, beside, that there was
so much truth in the Prince's bitter phrase&mdash;when
he was independent of his music,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
he felt certain that his music would be a
great success.</p>

<p>"It will be better so, Faustina," he said
at last; "you will be happier here. You
will have plenty to sing, plenty to teach
you. The Prince will be pleased."</p>

<p>She was still looking at him wonderingly,
but a smile was slowly growing in her eyes.
She judged him by a nature as generous
and unselfish as his was paltry and mean.</p>

<p>"You are saying this," she said, "for
my sake. You fear that I shall suffer
hardship and want. You sacrifice yourself&mdash;more
than yourself&mdash;for me."</p>

<p>This turn in the conversation completed
the vexation of the Maestro. When you
are doing a particularly mean thing, nothing
is more aggravating than to have noble
and generous motives imputed to you;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
and to have a very pretty woman offer
herself to you, unreservedly, when motives
of paltry selfishness render the offer unacceptable,
is enough to provoke any man.</p>

<p>The old man lost his temper completely.</p>

<p>"Faustina," he said, "you are a fool.
I have told you already that I intend to
travel, without thinking of work or of pay.
You must stay here. I shall not want you.
You have everything here you can wish.
The Prince is your lover. You have a
brilliant future before you. Don't let me
have any more trouble about you."</p>

<p>Still the girl could not believe that her
friend and teacher meant to cast her off.
She was looking at him wonderingly and
sadly.</p>

<p>"Maestro," she said, "you are not well.
You are cross and tired; we will not speak<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
of this any more to-night. This worry has
made you ill. To-morrow you will see
quite differently. You can never leave
your art&mdash;and Tina."</p>

<p>This feminine persistency, as it seemed
to him&mdash;this leaving a discussion open
which it was absolutely necessary should
be closed that night&mdash;was too much for the
Maestro.</p>

<p>"I leave Vienna," he said brutally,
"the day after to-morrow. I suppose that
you will not insist on following me uninvited.
If so, I shall know what to do."</p>

<p>This tone and look revealed to the girl,
at last, that she was cast off and discarded
by the only man for whom she really cared.
She threw herself on her knees beside his
chair, and caught his hand.</p>

<p>"Maestro," she said passionately, "you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
will not be so cruel! You will not leave
me! What can I do? How can I live,
without you? I cannot sing without you.
I am your child. You took me out of the
gutter; you taught me all I know; you
made me all I am. I will do anything you
tell me. I will not trouble you. I will
not speak even! I care for no one except
for you. I know you better, I can care for
you, can serve you better, than they all.
You will not be so cruel! You will not
send me away from you."</p>

<p>The more passionately she spoke, the
more rapid and fervent her utterance, the
more fretful and irritated did the old man
become. He pushed her roughly from him.</p>

<p>"Tina," he said again, "you are a fool.
Get up from your knees. I don't want
any of this stage-acting here."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<p>He rose himself, and began to wander
about the room, muttering and grumbling.</p>

<p>As he pushed her rudely from him, the
girl rose and, retreating some steps from
the table, gazed at him with a dazed,
wondering look, as of one before whose
eyes some strange unaccountable thing
was happening.</p>

<p>She was standing, in her brilliant beauty
and in her delicate and fantastic dress, her
hands clasped before her. The jewels on
her fingers and on her breast paled before
the solemn glow of her wonderful eyes,
which were dry, only from the intensity
of her thought.</p>

<p>"No," she said at last, as it would seem
in answer to some unspoken question.
"No. There is nothing strange in this.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
A woman's heart is easily won. I am not
the first, by many, who has found that out,
too late."</p>

<p>It might have seemed impossible to
one easily stirred, easily wrought upon by
a woman's beauty&mdash;it would surely have
seemed impossible to such a one that any
could gaze on a sight like this and harbour
a selfish thought; but the old man was
perfectly unmoved.</p>

<p>"It is always the way," he said
peevishly, "always the way with women;
now we shall have a scene&mdash;tears&mdash;entreaties.
I shall be called all manner
of hard names for giving sensible advice."</p>

<p>And he turned his back upon the girl,
and stood sullenly, gazing apparently upon
one of the painted panels of the wall.</p>

<p>For about a minute there was a terrible<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
pause, then the curtains that veiled the
<i>salon</i> were drawn forcibly back, and the
groom of the chambers, who was a Frenchman,
announced suddenly&mdash;</p>

<p>"<i>Monseigneur le Prince.</i>"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>VIII.</h2>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">The</span> Prince came forward smiling. The
Maestro made a gesture of inexpressible
relief. He shuffled off toward the still
opened curtain, and, turning as he reached
it, he bowed to the ground before his
patron and his pupil, and disappeared
through the opening as the servant let
the curtain drop. We shall not care, I
think, to see him again.</div>

<p>Faustina looked still more scared and
bewildered than before at this sudden
change of actors and of parts. She would
gladly have left the room but she was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
incapable of anything of the kind&mdash;besides,
where should she go? The scene seemed
to swim before her eyes, and the lights
to flicker. She sank down on her chair
again.</p>

<p>The Prince had never looked so well.
He was flushed with excitement, and the
habitual <i>insouciance</i> of his manner had
given place to a reality and earnestness of
purpose which rendered eloquent his every
gesture and look. He was exquisitely
dressed in silk, embroidered with flowers.
The priceless lace at his wrists and throat
accommodated itself, with a delicate fulness,
to the soft outline of his dress and figure.
His expression was full of kindliness and
protection, but of kindliness delicate and
refined. The girl's eyes were fascinated
in spite of herself.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<p>"Have you quarrelled with the Maestro,
Tina?" said the Prince. "He seemed in
a marvellous hurry to be gone."</p>

<p>Faustina made two or three ineffectual
attempts to speak before she could find
her voice. She burst into tears.</p>

<p>"He is cruel! cruel!" she said. "He
does not love me. He will not have me
any longer. He throws me away."</p>

<p>"Poor child!" said the Prince, "you
will not be deserted. I am your friend;
we are all your friends. The Maestro
even will come back to you. He is cross
and angry. When he finds how lost he
is without you and your lovely voice, he
will come back to you; you and he will
carry all before you again."</p>

<p>"Speak to him, Highness!" cried the
girl passionately. "You are kind and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
good to all&mdash;kinder than any one to me.
Speak to him! do not let him go without
me! He cannot live without his music,
and no one surely can know his music so
well as I, whom he has taught!"</p>

<p>She looked so indescribably attractive
in her tears and her distress that the
Prince wondered at the sight. "Let her
go, indeed!"</p>

<p>"Tina," he said very kindly, "I fear
that can hardly be. The Maestro is only
going for a time. There is, in fact, no
need that he should go at all. It is his
own wish, his own wish, Tina. He is too
old to make his way among strangers, and
will soon come back. But you we cannot
spare. You are too much a favourite
with us all. We are too much accustomed
to you: every one would miss<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
you&mdash;the Princess and all; you must stay
with us."</p>

<p>"I cannot stay," said the girl, looking
earnestly and beseechingly at the Prince.
"I want to go with him."</p>

<p>The Prince hesitated for a moment. In
an instantaneous flash of thought the two
paths lay open before him, plain and clear
to be seen. Carricchio's warning struck
him again with renewed force. The more
terrible presage of Mark's death cast itself,
ghostlike, before his steps. He could
plead no excuse of self-deception: he saw
the beauty and the danger of the way
which lay before him on either hand. He
hesitated for a moment, then he deliberately
chose the lower path.</p>

<p>"Tina," he said, "I cannot spare you;
you must not go. You are mine&mdash;I love<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
you; you belong to me;" and he stepped
forward, as if to take her in his arms.</p>

<p>The girl sprang to her feet. She drew
herself up to her full height, and her
splendid eyes, expanded to their full orbit,
flashed upon the Prince with a look of
astonishment and reproach. With the
entire power of her trained voice, which,
magnificent as it was, could still but
imperfectly render the reality of remonstrance
and pathetic regret, she uttered
but one word&mdash;"Prince!"</p>

<p>The cadence of her voice, trembling in
the passionate intensity of musical tone,
the whole power of her woman's nature,
exerted to its full in expostulation and
reproach&mdash;the magnetic force of her intense
consciousness&mdash;struck upon the conscience
and cultured taste of the Prince with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
crushing effect. He lost the perfectly
serene tone of pose and demeanour which
distinguished him and became him so well.
He aged perceptibly, incredible as it may
seem, ten years. The fatal step which he
had taken was revealed to him in a moment
as in a flash of light, with all the stain and
taint with which it had tarnished the fair
dream of finished art which he had conceived
it possible to perfect. He was
utterly demoralised and crushed. Mark's
death was nothing to this. That had been
a terrible mistake, but his part in it had
been indirect, and his motive, at least so
he flattered himself, comparatively high;
but this action, so entirely his own, revealed
to him, in its vulgar commonplaceness, by
the glorious perfection of the girl's action
and tone, withered him with a sense of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
irreparable failure and disgrace. He made
one or two ineffectual attempts to rally; it
was impossible&mdash;there was nothing for him
but to leave the room.</p>

<p>Faustina was unconscious of his going.
She found herself left alone. The situation
was still not without its difficulties.
She was alone, unattended by servants,
she knew not where to go, how to leave
the <i>H&ocirc;tel</i>. She lay for some time in a
sort of swoon; then she rose and wandered
from the room.</p>

<p>The only means of exit with which she
was acquainted was through the curtains
into the <i>salon</i>. She parted them and went
out, hardly knowing what she did.</p>

<p>The vast <i>salon</i> was but dimly lighted,
and no servants were to be seen; the
whole house seemed silent and deserted&mdash;more<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
especially these state apartments.
She passed slowly and with faltering steps
down the slippery floor of the <i>salon</i>, with
its dimly-lighted candelabra of massive
silver and its half-seen portraits, and, opening
the great door at the opposite end,
found herself in an antechamber which
communicated with a grand staircase, both
ascending and descending. To descend
was evidently useless&mdash;she could not go
out into the streets of Vienna alone at
night and in her fanciful dress. She went
up the wide staircase in the hope of finding
some female domestics who would help
her; as she reached the next flight the
sound of music, subdued and solemn, fell
upon her ear. She knew enough of German
music to know that it was the tune of
a hymn.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>

<p>The door of the room from which the
sound seemed to come stood partly open.
She went in.</p>

<p>Before an harpsichord, with her hand
carelessly passing over the keys, and her
head turned at the sound of footsteps,
stood the Princess Isoline. The light of
a branched candelabra fell full upon her
stately figure, revealing the compassionate,
lofty expression of her beautiful face.
The girl crossed the room towards her
and fell on her knees at her feet.</p>

<p>"Child," said the Princess, "what is it?
Why are you here?"</p>

<p>"I cannot tell," said the girl; and now
at last she found it possible to weep.
"I do not know what has happened.
The Maestro has forsaken me, and I have
insulted the Prince."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span></p>

<p>Gradually, in a broken way, she told
her story, kneeling by the Princess, who
stood serenely, her fingers still wandering
over the harpsichord keys, her left hand
caressing the girl's hair and cheek.</p>

<p>"He was a wonderful child," said the
Princess at last, more to herself than to
Faustina, for as she spoke she played again
the simple notes of the Lutheran hymn.
"He was truly a wonderful child. A very
Christ-child, it seems to me, in his simple
life and sudden death; for, though what
he did was little, yet the lives of all of us
seem different for his life&mdash;changed since
his death. As for me, since his life crossed
my path I have seen more, it seems to
me, of the mercy of God and of Christ's
working in paths and among lives where I
never thought to look for it before."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>

<p>Faustina did not reply, and the Princess
played several bars of the hymn before she
spoke again.</p>

<p>"Do you not see," she said at last,
"the blessing it has been also to my brother
the Prince?&mdash;for the desire that he felt,
surely a noble one, to refine the life of art
by the sacred touch of religion&mdash;the effort
that he made, though it seemed a failure,
and was made&mdash;it may be, I dare not judge
him&mdash;blindly, and in a mistaken fashion;
yet this effort has to-night proved his own
salvation, through you."</p>

<p>She stopped, and again the notes of the
hymn sounded through the room.</p>

<p>"Carricchio was right," she went on,
"when he told the Prince that you alone
of all of us had solved the riddle, for on
you alone has art exercised its supreme,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
its magic touch, in drawing out and developing
the emotions, the powers of the
soul. You alone possessed the perfect
gift of nature&mdash;the untainted well-spring
of natural life&mdash;which assimilated Mark's
spirit with your spirit, and reproduced his
life within your own."</p>

<p>Faustina dropped the Princess's hand,
which she had taken, and bent her head
still lower, as if shrinking from her kindly
praise.</p>

<p>"The Prince also had something of
this gift, and, in so far as he had, he built
up by his own action what, in his supreme
need, saved him from his lower self. I
have come to see that the world's virtues,
which, in my self-righteous isolation, I
despised, are often, as I blindly said to the
boy, nearer Christ's than my vaunted ones;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
that the world-spirit is often the Christ-spirit,
and that, when we begin to see that
His footsteps may be traced in paths where
we little expect to find them, we shall no
longer dare to talk of the secular life.
Your little brother that died was not without
his work, and the canary even was the
type of a nobler life, even as Mark's death
was the type of a nobler death. In strange
and unlooked-for ways the mission of sacrifice
and love fulfils itself, and, living in the
full light of its influence, we can never
realise the blessing we have derived, the
changed aspect of the race we have inherited,
from the Cross of Christ."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>

<h2>IX.</h2>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">The</span> next evening there was given, at the
Imperial Palace, a ball and supper, to
which none but <i>la haute noblesse</i> were
invited. The dancing began with a brilliant
Polonaise, which, headed by the Empress-Queen
and her husband, passed through
the rooms in stately procession, in singular
and picturesque contrast and harmony
with another faded and more solemn procession
and array of figures in antique
armour and dainty ruffs and doublets,
and gold chains and princely mantles,
the ancestral portraits who watched the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
formal slow dance-movement from the
walls.</div>

<p>After the Polonaise came the supper,
which was somewhat prolonged. The
supper over, a minuet was danced, and
afterward, the company being now happy
and cheerful, and being, moreover, of sufficiently
high and similar rank to dispense
with somewhat of the rigid court etiquette,
began to wander through the rooms in an
informal manner, and to arrange <i>contre-danses</i>
among themselves.</p>

<p>In those days the <i>contre-danse</i> had not
hardened itself into the quadrille. It was
danced, not in fours, but in sets of varying
numbers, and of characters and figures
mostly undefined.</p>

<p>In one of the great halls, recently erected
by the Emperor-architect, Charles VI.,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
in a different taste from the older rooms,
with marble floors and ceiling, and lined
with mirrors, a very large set, composed
of guests of the highest rank, was being
watched by no inconsiderable number of
their companions.</p>

<p>It is difficult to conceive a more magnificent
or fascinating sight, reflected and
multiplied as it was by the mirrors on the
walls.</p>

<p>The Princess von Isenberg-Wertheim
was dancing with a young noble, a prince
of the House of Colleredo, a very handsome,
but gay and reckless, young man. The
dance was drawing to a close, the musicians,
playing one of the last figures, <i>La Pastorelle</i>,
to a very delicate and fine movement, to
which the dancers were devoting their
utmost, closest attention and skill.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>

<p>As the Princess was standing by her
partner, awaiting their turn to go down the
dance, a slight movement caused her to
turn her head, and she found the Count,
her friend, standing close to her.</p>

<p>"I am sorry to interrupt, Princess," he
said, in a low voice, "but I fear something
serious has happened to the Prince. He
cannot be found."</p>

<p>The Princess turned very pale. She
caught her breath for a moment, then she
said, in the same tone, "Where is Karl,
the <i>Jager?</i>"</p>

<p>"I do not know," replied the Count.
"I never thought of him."</p>

<p>"Then he is not here," said the Princess,
with a relieved air. "If Karl is
with him the Prince is safe."</p>

<p>The Count made a very slight movement<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
of his shoulders, but the Princess
turned serenely to the young man.</p>

<p>"We will finish the figure, Monseigneur,"
she said graciously; "then,
perhaps, you will excuse me."</p>

<p>"Nothing has happened to the Prince,
believe me," said the young man kindly,
as they moved down the room. "He has
doubtless gone on some private expedition
with his servant. He probably forgot to
leave a message, and will return to-morrow."</p>

<p>The Princess was so reassured, apparently,
by these reflections that she remained
for the final figure of the dance. Then
she left the palace, and, declining the
Count's company, drove to her <i>H&ocirc;tel</i> alone.</p>

<p>She was more strangely moved than
she could have explained to herself. She
was, indeed, frightened and perplexed by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
her own feelings. She felt herself influenced
by an hitherto unrecognised power,
and, as it were, driven onwards by an overpowering
impulse, not her own.</p>

<p>Returning, as she did, at an unexpected
hour, her women were not in waiting for
her, and, leaving the servants who had
accompanied her from the palace in the
hall of the <i>H&ocirc;tel</i>, she wandered up the
great staircase alone. The corridors and
rooms were dimly lighted, and a perfect
stillness reigned through the house.</p>

<p>The Princess ascended slowly towards
her own apartment, where she expected to
find some, at least, of her dressers, and in
so doing, in a dimly-lighted corridor, she
passed the rooms allotted to her children.
The thought of them was not, indeed, in
her mind when, as she passed a door, she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
fancied that she heard a suppressed, continued
crying, as of children in distress.
Still more moved and troubled by this
faint pathetic sound she opened the door
and went in. The room was an antechamber,
and both it and the apartment
beyond were dark. The Princess procured
a small lamp from the corridor and
entered the suite of rooms.</p>

<p>In the bedchamber beyond the antechamber
she found the children, both
sitting up in one bed, clasped in each
other's arms, and crying quietly. The
little boy had evidently come for shelter
and comfort to his sister's bed.</p>

<p>"What is the matter, children?" said
the Princess, in a tone which seemed to
the little ones strangely soft and kind.
"Why are you not asleep?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span></p>

<p>The children had ceased crying, and
were looking at her wonderingly as she
stood in her jewels and ball-dress, a brilliant
scarf of Indian work hanging from her arm,
the lamp in her hand. They hardly knew
whether it was their mother, whom they
saw so seldom, or some serene ethereal
visitant, who resembled her in face and
form.</p>

<p>The little Princess, however, with the
self-possession of her class, apparently left
this point undecided, and began in her
quiet, stately little way to explain.</p>

<p>"It was dark," she said, "and we were
asleep, Fritz and I, and we both dreamed
the same dream. We thought that we
were walking in a beautiful garden, where
there were trees, and flowers, and butterflies,
and wide cascades of water, in which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
rainbows were shining; and while we were
playing there, and were very happy chasing
the butterflies, the Herr Tutor, who was an
angel, and who went to heaven, came and
took us by the hand; and, when we saw
his face, we knew that he is an angel now;
and he led us through the garden, and
talked to us of many things&mdash;of God, and
of angels, and of heaven&mdash;just as he used
to do. But I saw that, though he talked so
pleasantly, he was leading us out of this
pleasant garden, and the flowers grew dim,
and the butterflies flew away, and the sky
became very dark. And he led us quite
out of the garden into a burial-ground,
where there were tombs, and open graves,
and crosses, and tall dark trees that bore
no flower; and the Herr Tutor told us not
to be afraid, and led us on through the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
graves without speaking any more. He
led us into the midst of the burial-ground,
and in the midst of the burial-ground there
was a Calvary, and at the foot of the Calvary
there was a bier. And on the bier
we saw you and papa lying quite straight
and still, and we thought that you were
dead. And the Herr Tutor vanished
away; and we were so frightened that we
cried. And we knelt side by side, and
prayed to the Christ that He would come
down. And the Christ came down from
the cross, and came to the bier, and touched
it, and you and papa stood up beautiful
and smiling, and came towards us with outstretched
hands, and the Christ vanished
away. And we were so glad that we
awoke; and it was dark, and there was no
Christ, and no Herr Tutor, who is an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
angel, and no papa, and no one to tell us
what to do or where to go."</p>

<p>As the little Princess ceased some
servants came in, with whispered explanations
and apologies. The Princess
went to her own room. She had not
known what to say to the child; indeed,
she hardly knew what had passed. She
allowed herself to be undressed, and lay
down.</p>

<p>But, in the deep silence of the hours
that preceded the dawn, an overpowering
restlessness took possession of her. A
sense of strange forces and influences,
to which she was utterly unaccustomed,
seemed present to her spirit: a crowd of
fair and heavenly existences, which seemed
to follow on the steps of that singular boy
who had first attracted her wearied fancy,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
the Signorina's singing, which had stamped
this impression upon her mind, the strange
tenderness she had been conscious of, the
renewed sense of her husband's grace and
beauty, his alarming absence, her children's
mystical dream. A new world seemed
to open to her. She felt how poor and
bare her life had been, how deserted
by these gracious creatures of the imagination,
how unblessed by the purest,
the truest art&mdash;the art of pathos and of
love.</p>

<p>With the streaks of dawn that stole into
the chamber she was conscious of an irrepressible
desire that took possession of
her to rise and go forth. An irresistible
power seemed to draw her to follow: she
rose, and, dressing herself in such clothes
as were at hand, she went out.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span></p>

<p>The house itself was quite still, but
faintly in the distance might be heard the
sound of a bell. In so religious a Court
as that of Vienna there were private
chapels attached to most of the houses
of the nobility, and there was one attached
to a neighbouring palace, to which there
was a private communication with the
<i>H&ocirc;tel</i> taken by the Prince.</p>

<p>Following the sound of the bell the
Princess traversed several passages, and
reached at last a staircase, down which she
turned. As she reached the first landing
two women came out from an open door.
They started at the sight of the Princess.
They were the Princess Isoline and
Faustina.</p>

<p>"Is it you, Princess?" said the former.
"What has called you up so early?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span></p>

<p>"Are you going to the chapel, Isoline?"
said the Princess. "May I come with
you?"</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>The three ladies entered the chapel by
a private door, which led them to a pew
behind the stalls. Upon the original
Gothic stone-work and tracery of the
chapel, which was very old, had been
introduced rococo work in mahogany and
brass, angels and trumpets and scrolls.
The stalls and organs were covered with
filigree work of this description, the windows
filled with paintings in the same
florid and incongruous taste. There were
few persons in the chapel, most of them
being ladies from the adjoining palaces,
together with a few musicians, for the
musical part of the service was carefully<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
performed by a large and well-paid
staff.</p>

<p>Two of the ladies were Protestant, the
third, Faustina, a Catholic of a very undeveloped
type; but the music of the Mass
spoke a mysterious language, recognisable
to hearts of every creed.</p>

<p>Before the altar, laden with gilded plate
and lighted with candles in silver sconces,
the priest said Mass. Above him, in the
window, painted in a lovely Italian landscape
full of figures, with towns and castles
and mountain ranges and market-people
with horses and cattle, were represented,
in careful and minute painting, the three
Marys before the empty tomb.</p>

<p>"The City of the Sunlight," sang the
choir, in an elaborate anthem, with an
allegro movement of the tenors that spoke<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
of sunshine amid the grass and flowers and
flashing sea, of the breezy south wind upon
rippling water and golden hair; and after
them the bass recitative, with a positive
assurance that knew no doubt, asserted
"The gates&mdash;the gates of it are many&mdash;many,"
which the tenors and altos, with
a sudden inspiration, interpreted, "God's
purposes fulfilled&mdash;fulfilled in many ways;"
and the whole choir, in a minor key, as
with hushed and awe-struck voices, completed
the theme, "But the end is union
in the heart&mdash;the heart of the Crucifix; in
the City&mdash;the City of the Saints."</p>

<div class='center'><b>*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *</b></div>

<p>On her return from the chapel a note
from the Prince was put into the Princess's
hand. It merely stated that he was gone
to Hernhuth to the Count Zinzendorf. It<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
had been written at a tavern in the environs
of the city, after his sudden determination
had been formed the day before, and had
been entrusted to a servant of the inn to
deliver. He had arrived at the <i>H&ocirc;tel</i>
after the Princess had left, and, on asking
for her Highness, had been told by a
careless porter that she was at the Palace.
Wandering about the Palace courts late at
night he had been arrested as a suspicious
person, and kept prisoner till the morning.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>In course of time (posts were slow in
those days) the Princess received a long
letter from her husband, giving an account
of Hernhuth, and of his conversations with
the Count, and concluding with these
words:&mdash;</p>

<p>"From all this you will, doubtless, conclude<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
that Hernhuth does not suit me very
well, and that the Count and I do not
always agree. It would be more after
Isoline's taste. I like the children's dream,
as you tell it, best. We have been dead,
and laid upon a bier; but we will, please
God, live hereafter for the children and
the Christ."</p>

directed to</i> The Border Edition
of the Waverley Novels, <i>edited by Mr.
Andrew Lang, which, with its large type
and convenient form, and its copious illustrations
by well-known artists, possesses
features which place it in the forefront of
editions now obtainable of the famous novels.</i>

<h2>The Border Waverley</h2>

<h3>SOME OPINIONS OF THE PRESS</h3>


<p><i>TIMES.</i>&mdash;"It would be difficult to find in these days a more competent
and sympathetic editor of Scott than his countryman, the brilliant
and versatile man of letters who has undertaken the task, and if any proof
were wanted either of his qualifications or of his skill and discretion in
displaying them, Mr. Lang has furnished it abundantly in his charming
Introduction to 'Waverley.' The editor's own notes are judiciously sparing,
but conspicuously to the point, and they are very discreetly separated from
those of the author, Mr. Lang's laudable purpose being to illustrate and
explain Scott, not to make the notes a pretext for displaying his own
critical faculty and literary erudition. The illustrations by various competent
hands are beautiful in themselves and beautifully executed, and, altogether,
the 'Border Edition' of the Waverley Novels bids fair to become the
classical edition of the great Scottish classic."</p>

<p><i>SPECTATOR.</i>&mdash;"We trust that this fine edition of our greatest and
most poetical of novelists will attain, if it has not already done so, the high
popularity it deserves. To all Scott's lovers it is a pleasure to know that,
despite the daily and weekly inrush of ephemeral fiction, the sale of his
works is said by the booksellers to rank next below Tennyson's in poetry,
and above that of everybody else in prose."</p>

<p><i>ATHEN&AElig;UM.</i>&mdash;"The handsome 'Border Edition' has been brought
to a successful conclusion. The publisher deserves to be complimented
on the manner in which the edition has been printed and illustrated, and
Mr. Lang on the way in which he has performed his portion of the work.
His introductions have been tasteful and readable; he has not overdone
his part; and, while he has supplied much useful information, he has by no
means overburdened the volumes with notes."</p>

<p><i>NOTES AND QUERIES.</i>&mdash;"This spirited and ambitious enterprise
has been conducted to a safe termination, and the most ideal edition of the
Waverley Novels in existence is now completed."</p>

<p><i>SATURDAY REVIEW.</i>&mdash;"Of all the many collections of the
Waverley Novels, the 'Border Edition' is incomparably the most handsome
and the most desirable.... Type, paper, illustrations, are altogether
admirable."</p>

<p><i>MAGAZINE OF ART.</i>&mdash;"Size, type, paper, and printing, to say
nothing of the excessively liberal and charming introduction of the illustrations,
make this perhaps the most desirable edition of Scott ever issued on
this side of the Border."</p>

<p><i>DAILY CHRONICLE.</i>&mdash;"There is absolutely no fault to be found
with it, as to paper, type, or arrangement."</p>
